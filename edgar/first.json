{"content": {"11": "Information required by Item\u00a011 of Part III is included in our Proxy Statement relating to our \n Annual Meeting of Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference. ", "1A": "Please carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers\u2019 demands;\nour ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\nour ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\nthe introduction of competitive websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\nchanges in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\ntiming, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\nthe success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\nthe extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\nthe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\nvariations in the mix of products and services we sell;\nvariations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\nthe extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\nthe extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\nincreases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies;\nthe extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items;\nthe extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\nour ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\nthe extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\ngovernment regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\nlaws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\nAs international e-commerce and other online and web services grow, competition will intensify. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) and India regulate Amazon\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i)\u00a0foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii)\u00a0Internet content, and (iii)\u00a0the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely. \nIf We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be Harmed\nIf we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nIn addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. Orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location, and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for drop-shipping. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network. \nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.\nThird parties either drop-ship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers\u2019 orders, and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability, quality, and future procurement of their services. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\nThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nWe expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item\u00a01A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory.\nWe generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December\u00a031 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December\u00a031. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\nOur Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships\nWe provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, if the other company\u2019s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\nvariability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\ndifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\nOur Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as:\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\nthe potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\nthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\nthe difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\nfor investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\nthe difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\nfor foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Chinese Yuan, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S.\u00a0Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\nAs a result of our services being web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our customers, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harm our business. We use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item\u00a01A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\nWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item\u00a01A, as well as:\nconditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;\nfluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;\nchanges in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;\nchanges in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\nchanges in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\ntransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, the characteristics and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Sales Tax or Other Indirect Tax Liabilities\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales in the U.S. However, an increasing number of states, and certain foreign jurisdictions, have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf. We support a Federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system. More than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we already collect sales tax or other indirect taxes were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially.\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard. \nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, \nas well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. \nWe May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\nWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating \nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\nWe Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\nThe law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments,\u00a0fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers\u2019 descriptions.

Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of \nCash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities\n of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):\nThe fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of \n based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of \n, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst\u00a0& Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. \nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended \n that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of \n, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nIn our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. as of \n, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended ", "9B": "", "1": "This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing.

We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations.

We design our websites to enable millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our websites directly and through our mobile websites and apps. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, an annual membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on millions of items, access to unlimited instant streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; and digital delivery. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item\u00a02 of Part\u00a0I, \u201cProperties.\u201d\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions, but instead earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof.\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. \nWe serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online platform that lets independent authors and publishers choose a 70% royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon\u2019s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content.\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The international marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1)\u00a0online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2)\u00a0publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3)\u00a0web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4)\u00a0companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5)\u00a0companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; and (7)\u00a0companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019 ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December\u00a031.

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item\u00a01A of Part\u00a0I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers\n. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows\n Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital\n and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns\u00a0the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were \nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs.\n Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\nSee \u201cResults of Operations\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\nWorking capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.\nBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle\n On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover\n. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days\n. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies.\n We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S.\u00a0Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends\n. For example, if the U.S.\u00a0Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S.\u00a0Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\nFor additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item\u00a08 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014Description of Business and Accounting Policies.\u201d\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\u2019s\u00a0financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item\u00a08 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014Description of Business and Accounting Policies.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.\nInventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.\nAccounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. \nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of \n, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $115 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the second quarter of 2015, we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\nDuring the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April\u00a01, 2015, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.\nFinancial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our \n closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment.\nWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $46 million impact on our \n operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates as of \nWe utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard. \nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \nSee Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014Description of Business and Accounting Policies\u2014Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were \n, and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.\n. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash charges to net income (loss) such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital. The \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in non-cash charges to net income (loss), including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. \nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was \n, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were \n. This primarily reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million, $537 million, and $493 million for internal-use software and website development in \n. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In \n, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of \nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was \n. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were \n. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were \n reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were \n. During 2014, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044. See Item\u00a08 of Part\u00a0II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 5\u2014Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were \nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion Credit Agreement as of \n. See Item\u00a08 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 5\u2014Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information.\u00a0\n. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of \n, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $5.8 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of \n. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were \n, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately \n of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d to restricted cash, which is classified within \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. As of \n, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were \n. See Item\u00a08 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 7\u2014Commitments and Contingencies\u201d for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $6.2 billion as of \n. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\nOn average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was \n. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on\u00a0in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item\u00a01A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. \nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part 1,\u201cFinancial Statements\u2014Note 11\u2014Segment Information.\u201d \nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, digital content subscriptions, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by \n. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below.\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. \n, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by \n. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such \nas electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. \n, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.\nSegment operating income (loss) is as follows (in millions):\nThe increase in North America segment operating income in absolute dollars in \n, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $30 million, $0, and $7 million for \nThe decrease in International segment operating loss in absolute dollars in \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity, spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates was $278 million, $27 million, and $70 million for \n. The decrease in International segment operating income (loss) in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. \nThe increase in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. The decrease in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by increased usage. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $264 million, $41 million, and $38 million for \nSupplemental information about outbound shipping results for our North America and International segments is as follows (in millions):\nExcludes amounts charged on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service.\nIncludes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships.\nIncludes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services.\nIncludes North America and International segment net sales.\nWe expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing placement of fulfillment centers, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nWe have aggregated our North America and International segments\u2019 products and services into groups of similar products and services and provided the supplemental disclosure of net sales (in millions) below. We evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate when a product or service category begins to approach a significant level of net sales. For the periods presented, no individual product or service represented more than 10% of net sales.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\nIncludes sales from non-retail activities, such as certain advertising services and our\u00a0co-branded credit card agreements.\nInformation about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions):\nOperating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Item\u00a08 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014Description of Business and Accounting Policies\u2014Stock-Based Compensation.\u201d\nIn 2014, we recorded charges estimated at $170 million primarily related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, the majority of which was included in the North America segment. \nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. The increase in 2014 was also impacted by the expansion of digital offerings and Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs.\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and content.\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction \nand fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, direct sales, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses.\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses. Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. Digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross, including Prime Video, are included in cost of sales.\nWe seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in \n, compared to comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment, and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services.\nTechnology infrastructure costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. In \n, we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS service offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage.\nThe increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services.\n of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was \n in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. The \n in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in \n, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.\n, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees.\n, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.\nFor the reasons discussed above, income from operations \nWe believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.\n. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\n is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt, and capital and finance lease arrangements. \n. See Item\u00a08 of Part\u00a0II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 5\u2014Long-Term Debt and Note 6\u2014Other Long-Term Liabilities\u201d for additional information.\n. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses).\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. \n. Our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.\nOur provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments, partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our European operations. \nWe have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the U.S. federal research and development credit. As of \n, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately \n of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 10\u2014Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was \n, and is primarily related to our investment in LivingSocial. The primary component of this activity during \n was our share of a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by LivingSocial during the period.\nThe effect on our income from operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S.\u00a0Dollar is as follows (in millions):\nRepresents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.\nRepresents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows, operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by \u201cPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net\u201d which is included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, \u201cNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\u201d for \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by \u201cPrincipal repayments of capital lease obligations,\u201d and \u201cPrincipal repayments of finance lease obligations,\u201d which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOperating Expenses, Excluding Stock-Based Compensation\nOperating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment \nresults, and therefore, excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the \u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cMarketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d line items would be higher.\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S.\u00a0Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period.\n, in our earnings release furnished on Form\u00a08-K as set forth below.

We seek to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websites and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which provides access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements. \n segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \u201cNote\u00a011\u2014Segment Information.\u201d \nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including recasting the segment financial information within \u201cNote 11\u2014Segment Information\u201d as a result of changing our reportable segments to include an AWS segment. \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation and impairment of investments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collectability of receivables, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, depreciable lives of property and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equity interests, and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. In 2014, we excluded stock awards of \nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\nWe recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each element. Estimated selling prices are management\u2019s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements separately and include considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost of producing the product or service. \nSales of our digital devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo, are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/or undelivered non-software services such as cloud storage and free trial memberships to other services. The revenue allocated to the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sale price, and related costs are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue related to undelivered software upgrades and/or undelivered non-software services is deferred and recognized generally on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices. \nSales of Amazon Prime memberships are also considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, including shipping benefits, Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Photos, and access to the Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library. The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the estimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we will update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of each element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees. \nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof.\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Amazon\u2019s electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers. \nService sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, digital content subscriptions, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Service sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, are recognized when service has been rendered.\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue, are estimated using historical experience. Allowance for returns was \n. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales and consumption taxes. Additionally, we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in \u201cTotal net sales.\u201d\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in \u201cFulfillment\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive funds for advertising services, cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, and volume rebates.\u00a0We generally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and therefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment.\u00a0Vendor rebates are typically dependent upon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. \nWhen we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor\u2019s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as an offset to \u201cMarketing\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments\u2019 fulfillment and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.\nMarketing costs primarily consist of targeted online advertising, television advertising, public relations expenditures, and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. We pay commissions to participants in our Associates program when their customer referrals result in product sales and classify such costs as \u201cMarketing\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\nAdvertising and other promotional costs are expensed as incurred and were \n. Prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of \nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses.\nContent costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection.\nTechnology and content costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and applications supporting our business, which are capitalized and amortized over \nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment, such as depreciation expense and rent; professional fees and litigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources, among others.\nCompensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense and expenses related to legal settlements.\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign currency losses of \n, and realized gains (losses) on marketable securities sales of \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside of the U.S were \n. Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\u00a0We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\u2014Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\u2014Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\u2014Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of \nAs part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock primarily in private companies. We record these assets in \u201cOther assets\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Equity warrant assets are classified as Level 3 assets, and the balances and related activity for our equity warrant assets were not significant for the periods ended \nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. \nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers\u2019 programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \nIncluded in \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customer and seller receivables and vendor receivables. As of \nWe estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was \nCosts incurred to develop software for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software\n Costs related to design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended \n of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, financing, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment, servers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. \nDepreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets\n or the remaining life of the underlying building, \n for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a \nlease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as finance leases.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. \nwe changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1\n. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in the delay, acceleration, or avoidance of an impairment charge. \nWe believe this timing better aligns the goodwill impairment test with our strategic business planning process, which is a key component of the goodwill impairment test. \nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2015, and determined that goodwill is not impaired. There were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessment through \n that would require an update to our annual impairment test. See \u201cNote\u00a04\u2014Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.\u201d\nIncluded in \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of amortization; video and music content, net of amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; intellectual property rights, net of amortization; and equity warrant assets.\nWe obtain video and music content to be made available to Prime members through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions and generally have terms from \n years with fixed payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and available for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee per title and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to \u201cCost of sales\u201d on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated viewing patterns over each title\u2019s contractual window of availability, which typically ranges from \n years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original content. The production costs of internally developed content are capitalized only if persuasive evidence exists that the production will generate revenue. Prior to 2015, because we had limited history to support the economic benefits of our content, we generally expensed such costs as incurred. In 2015, we began capitalizing a portion of production costs as we have developed more experience to support that future revenue will be earned. Capitalized internally developed costs are generally amortized to \u201cCost of sales\u201d on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the first months after availability. \nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d or \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as available-for-sale, and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss.\u201d\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within \u201cOther assets\u201d \non our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as \u201cEquity\nmethod investment activity, net of tax\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and classified as \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions, and additional investments.\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are included in \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss.\u201d\nWe periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset\u2019s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of Amazon Prime memberships and AWS services. \nWe have internationally-focused websites for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom\n Net sales generated from these websites, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss,\u201d a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity, and in the \u201cForeign-currency effect on cash and cash equivalents,\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our method of adoption and the impact this ASU, and related amendments and interpretations, will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued an ASU modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method and is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes and requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and expect this ASU will have an impact on our consolidated balance sheets as our current deferred tax assets were \nNote 2\u2014CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities.

For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This is principally due to our significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the related leases\u2019 terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-term construction obligations are considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as \u201cAccrued expenses and other.\u201d Gross assets remaining under finance leases were \n.

In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further \nproceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations.

Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.\nOur provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments, partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our European operations. \nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.\nThe reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):\n, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.\n, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of \n.

As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately \n, subject to interest. To date, we have not resolved this matter administratively and are currently contesting it in U.S. Tax Court. We continue to disagree with these IRS positions and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. \nCertain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (\u201cFTA\u201d) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter.\n These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes. In September 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions. In June 2015, we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French tax of \n, including interest and penalties through September 2012. We disagree with the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously. We plan to pursue all available administrative remedies at the FTA, and if we are not able to resolve this matter with the FTA, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2006 through 2010, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. \nIn addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.\n If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. \nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.\n\u00a0We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments in respect of these particular jurisdictions for \nWe expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in \n. In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through \n. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. \nWe allocate to segment results the operating expenses \u201cFulfillment,\u201d \u201cMarketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. We exclude from our allocations the portions of these operating expense lines attributable to stock-based compensation. We do not allocate the line item \u201cOther operating expense (income), net\u201d to our segment operating results. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments.\nThe North America segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused websites such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca, and www.amazon.com.mx. This segment includes export sales from these websites.\nThe International segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused websites such as www.amazon.com.au, www.amazon.com.br, www.amazon.cn, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.in, www.amazon.it, www.amazon.co.jp, www.amazon.nl, www.amazon.es, and www.amazon.co.uk.

The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II,\nItem\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u0094 of this Form 10-K. \nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. \nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global\nand regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in\nincome or asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s\nexpectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include\nincreases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior.\nThese and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. \nIn\nthe event of further financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental\ntightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or\nfinancial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to \n\nfinance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the\nCompany\u0092s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restricting the Company\u0092s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on\ngains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; volatility in foreign\nexchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the\nCompany\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \nGlobal\nmarkets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \nThe Company\u0092s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and\nproduct advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete\nsuccessfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution\nfor its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development. The Company currently holds a significant\nnumber of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low\ncost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u0092s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors\ninfringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. \nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a\nminority market share in the smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s product features and applications within their own\nproducts or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of\nthe Company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be\nable to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nindividual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to\nmaintain their functional and design advantages. \nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a\nminority market share in the personal computer market. This market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number\nof competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed \n\ncustomer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal\ncomputers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the\nCompany\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and\ntransitions. \nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number\nof factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software\nfor new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new\nproducts may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. \nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added\nresellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small\nand mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. \nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone\ntypically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters\ninto with new carriers. \nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak\neconomic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage\nresellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,\nincluding staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.\nThe financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and\nmarketing of the Company\u0092s products. \nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk. \nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have\nbecome obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\nsuppliers\u0092 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the \n\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets\nexceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not\nincur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a\ncombination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with\nthe\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. \nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing\nrisks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of\ncomponents, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u0092s suppliers, described in\n\u0093\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n above, also could affect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases. \nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices\nand personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The\nCompany\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing\ncapacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the\nCompany\u0092s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. \nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are\nlocated outside of the U.S. \nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a\nfew outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over\nproduction and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these\npartners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. \nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners in Asia for final assembly of\nsubstantially all \n\nof the Company\u0092s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition,\nmanufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\nmilitary actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. \nThe Company has invested in\nmanufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of\ncomponents and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted. \nThe Company\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and\noperating margin and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and\nservices that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended\noperation. The Company\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company\nwill be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable\nterms or at all. \nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes\nStore. This includes the right to make available music, movies, TV shows and books currently available through the iTunes Store. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of\nthese arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of\ncontent at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms,\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \nSome third-party\ndigital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the\nCompany will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights\nmanagement, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u0092s content providers. \nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from \nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of \n software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u0092s products. If\nthird-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of \n software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s\nproducts compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of Mac sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the\nCompany\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution\nchannel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to\nreduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In addition, iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might\nnot successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the\nrelative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\nthe Company\u0092s iOS devices may suffer. \nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may\nnot be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \nMany of the Company\u0092s products include\nthird-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance\nthat the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from\nselling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights. \nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. \nFor example, technology companies, including many of the\nCompany\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or\notherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media\ndevice companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and\nbefore the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in Europe and Asia. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential\nor actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. \nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing\nagreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations,\nand distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \nIn management\u0092s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\ncontingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. \nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary\ndamages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or\nin the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u0092s business. \nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting\nits domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,\nreal estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. \nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could\ninclude, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are also\nsubject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in\nadditional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the Company from selling certain products.\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and\ndoing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the\nCompany\u0092s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies and procedures. \nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S.\nand foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements,\n\n\nenvironmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to\ncomply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. \nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other\ncosts, and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade\nregulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can\neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \nThe Company\u0092s Retail segment has required and will continue to\nrequire a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \nThe\nCompany\u0092s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space.\nCertain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. \nMany\nfactors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on\ngeneral retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\u0092s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging\nenvironments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\u0092s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable\ncost. \nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present\nrisks not originally contemplated. \nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not\ndiscovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \nThe\nCompany\u0092s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. \nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters,\naccidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u0092s\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u0092s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and\nresult in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting. \nThere may be breaches of the Company\u0092s information technology systems that\nmaterially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable\ninformation (\u0093PII\u0094). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access\nto PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages. \nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and\nauthentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance,\nfaulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the\nCompany\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of\ncustomer orders. \nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures\nto protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage\nbusiness partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII,\nthe Company\u0092s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. \nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding\ndata protection. \nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,\nretention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties\nwith which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction\nto jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal\nliability. \nThe Company\u0092s privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on\nits website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and\nregulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. \nThe Company is also subject\nto payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and\npenalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card\ntransaction costs. \nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of\nkey personnel. \nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key\npersonnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are located. \nThe Company\u0092s business may be impacted by political\nevents, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances. \nWar, terrorism, geopolitical\nuncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers,\nlogistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents,\nterrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and\ndeliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the\nCompany could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and\ndisruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical\nbusiness operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial\nrecovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. \nThe Company expects its quarterly\nrevenue and operating results to fluctuate. \nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary across its products and distribution\nchannels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product\nlines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its\nindirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or\nchannel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. \nThe Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. The Company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the\nCompany\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility. \nThe Company\u0092s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and\nvolume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock\nto exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price reflects \n\nexpectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors, and the Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of\nshares. If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact\non investor confidence and employee retention. \nThe Company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated\nwith changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. \nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in\nforeign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales\nof products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\nlocal prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments,\nthereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in\nplace. \nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and\npricing of the Company\u0092s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could\nresult in a significant realized loss. \nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor\nnon-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has\nmade prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a028, 2013, a significant portion of the Company\u0092s trade receivables was\n\n\nconcentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located\nprimarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its\ncredit risk and avoid losses. \nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or\ninternational tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. \nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u0092s\nfuture effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation,\nincluding in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u0092s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u0092s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u0092s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be\nadversely affected.

", "7A": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a \n basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given\nthe effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in\neither foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely\naffect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S.\ninterest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging. \nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the\nCompany. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external\nmanager performance. \nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate\nrisk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel\nshift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a028, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\nportfolio. As of September\u00a029, 2012, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\nsold the investments prior to maturity. \nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To\nmanage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate\nnotes. \nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local \n\ncurrency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a portion of its material\nforeign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic\ncost of hedging particular exposures. \nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain\nof the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency\nderivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm\ncommitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of September\u00a029, 2012. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments\nare generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \nActual future gains and losses associated\nwith the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a028, 2013 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions.

", "9A": "Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the\nCompany\u0092s management, the Company\u0092s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u0092s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u0093Exchange Act\u0094) were effective as of September\u00a028, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange\nAct is (i)\u00a0recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii)\u00a0accumulated and communicated to the Company\u0092s management, including its\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \nThe Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094). The Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nCompany\u0092s assets; \nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and\nthat the Company\u0092s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u0092s management and directors; and \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u0092s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nManagement, including the Company\u0092s\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u0092s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nManagement\u0092s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThe Company\u0092s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u0096 Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Based on the Company\u0092s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm,\nErnst\u00a0& Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form\u00a010-K. \nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2013, which were\nidentified in connection with management\u0092s evaluation required by paragraph (d)\u00a0of \n and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting.

AC+ is a fee-based service available in certain countries for iPhone and iPad. AC+\noffers additional coverage under some circumstances for instances of accidental damage in addition to the services offered by APP. \nThe Company\u0092s customers are primarily in the consumer, SMB, education, enterprise and government\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and SMBs through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. During 2013, the Company\u0092s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for\u00a030%\nand\u00a070%, respectively, of total net sales.\nThe Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products\nare enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its\ntargeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.\n\nTo ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company\ncontinues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company\u0092s retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping\ndistricts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and\nenhance the presentation and marketing of the Company\u0092s products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party\nhardware, software, and other accessories and peripherals that complement the Company\u0092s products. \nThe Company has also\ninvested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party\nresellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services. \nThe Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels\nof student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials\nthrough iTunes U\n, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media\nonline. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores. \nThe Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government\ncustomers in each of its geographic segments. The Company\u0092s products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Company\u0092s\nproducts are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration. \nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2013, 2012 or 2011. \nThe markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are\nhighly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the\ncapabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and other digital electronic devices. The Company\u0092s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have\naggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins.\nPrincipal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and peripherals ecosystem, marketing and\ndistribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \nThe Company is focused on expanding its market\nopportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to\nintensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company\u0092s products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than\nthose they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and\nprice sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \nThe Company\u0092s digital content services have faced significant\ncompetition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. \nThe Company\u0092s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company\u0092s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in\nwhich it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod), software (iOS, OS X and iTunes), online services, and distribution of digital content\nand applications (iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and Mac App Store). Some of the Company\u0092s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even\nat a loss to compete with the Company\u0092s offerings. \nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components\nare currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and\nnew products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or\nmanufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company\u0092s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u0092s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from\nthe original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. \nThe Company has entered into various\nagreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \nWhile the\nCompany has announced plans to begin manufacturing some Macs in the United States, substantially all of the Company\u0092s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant\nconcentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the\nCompany\u0092s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\u0092s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production\ncommitments. The Company\u0092s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u0092s\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\nproducts and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Total research and development expense was $4.5 billion, $3.4\nbillion and $2.4 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod devices,\nperipherals, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and\nservice marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is\ncurrently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world.\u00a0Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and worldwide.\u00a0The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its\nproducts and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u0092s products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. \nMany of the Company\u0092s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained\nfrom third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms\nin the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company\u0092s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has\nbeen notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. \nForeign and Domestic\nOperations and Geographic Data \nDuring 2013, the Company\u0092s domestic and international net sales accounted for\u00a039%\nand\u00a061%, respectively, of total net sales.\u00a0Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item\u00a07 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \u0093Segment Operating Performance,\u0094 and in Part II,\nItem\u00a08 of this Form \n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, \u0093Segment Information and Geographic Data.\u0094 \nWhile substantially all of the Company\u0092s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, the Company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in Ireland. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\nEurope. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by\ninternational trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form \n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies.\u0094 \nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions\ncan significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company\u0092s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a\nproduct introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However,\nneither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company\u0092s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance. \nThe Company\noffers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a \n\nbasic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company\u0092s hardware products. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Company\u0092s hardware products. \nIn the\nCompany\u0092s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product\nintroductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company\u0092s ability to\nachieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had approximately 80,300 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 4,100 full-time equivalent temporary employees and contractors.

In the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims\nbrought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period\nfor amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Apple Computer, Inc. and Tucker v. Apple Computer, Inc.); Somers v. Apple Inc. \nThese related cases were filed on January\u00a03, 2005,\u00a0July\u00a021, 2006 and December\u00a031, 2007 in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of direct and indirect purchasers of iPods and iTunes Store content, alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music and video purchased on the iTunes\nStore with the purchase of iPods and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power under \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 of the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, California Business\u00a0& Professions Code \u00a717200 (unfair competition), the\nCalifornia Consumer Legal Remedies Act and California monopolization law. Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for the class, treble damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement of revenues and/or profits and attorneys\nfees. Plaintiffs are also seeking digital rights management free versions of any songs downloaded from iTunes or an order requiring the Company to license its digital rights management to all competing music players. On September\u00a03, 2013, the\nU.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\u0092s dismissal of the indirect purchaser case, Somers v. Apple Inc. The remaining direct purchaser\u00a0cases are currently pending. \nApple eBooks Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.) \nOn April\u00a011, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u0093DOJ\u0094) filed a civil antitrust action against the Company and five\nmajor book publishers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of \u00a71 of the Sherman Act and seeking, among other things, injunctive\nrelief, the District Court\u0092s declaration that the Company\u0092s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Court\u0092s reformation of such agreements. The DOJ\u0092s complaint asserted, among other things,\nthat the decision by the five publishers to shift to an agency model to sell eBooks and their agreements with the Company were an attempt to \u0093raise, fix and stabilize retail e-book prices, to end price competition among e-book retailers, and to\nlimit retail price competition.\u0094 The Company filed a response to the DOJ complaint in late May 2012, denying the DOJ\u0092s allegations. All five publishers reached a settlement with the DOJ, which required the publishers to terminate their\nagreements with the Company and renegotiate new agreements pursuant to the terms of their settlement with the DOJ. On July\u00a010, 2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade in violation of\n\u00a71 of the Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with \u00a71 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0The District Court entered a permanent injunction, which took effect on October\u00a06, 2013 and will be in effect\nfor five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal.

The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and\ndirect sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers.

The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers. \nNet sales rose 9% or $14.4 billion during 2013 compared to 2012. This resulted from growth in net sales of iPhone; iTunes, software, and services; and iPad. Growth in 2013 reflects strong sales of iPhone\n5, strong continuing sales of iPhone 4 and 4s, the introduction of iPhone 5c and 5s, strong performance of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad, and continued growth in the Company\u0092s online sales of apps, digital content, and services.\nGrowth in these areas was partially offset by declines in net sales of Mac and iPod. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced increased net sales in 2013, with net sales growth being particularly strong in the Americas, Greater China\nand Japan operating segments. Similar to 2012, growth in total net sales was higher during the first half of 2013, rising $12.6 billion or 14.7% over the same period in 2012. First half growth in 2013 was driven by iPhone and iPad introductions at\nor near the beginning of 2013. \nDuring the first quarter of 2013, the Company introduced the fourth generation iPad and iPad\nMini, a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a new iPod touch, a new iMac, and expanded the rollout of iPhone 5 which began in September 2012. In June 2013 at its Worldwide Developer Conference, the Company announced iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks,\nannounced iTunes Radio, introduced a significant upgrade to MacBook Air, and provided a preview of all new Mac Pro desktops expected to be introduced during 2014. In September 2013, the Company introduced iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, released iOS 7,\nlaunched iTunes Radio, and announced that beginning in September 2013 iPhoto, iMovie and iWork apps for iOS would be available as free downloads with all new \u0093iOS devices,\u0094 namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. In October 2013, the Company\nannounced iPad Air\u0099, its fifth generation iPad, and iPad mini with Retina display. \nIn April 2013 the Company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital\nto shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to utilize for the program through December 2015 to $100 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $3.05 per\ncommon share beginning in May 2013. During 2013, the Company utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $11.40 per common share. In conjunction with its capital return program, in May 2013 the Company\nissued $17.0 billion of notes with varying maturities through 2043. \nOverall net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced\nincreased net sales during 2012, primarily a result of strong demand for iPhone and iPad. Growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. The net\nsales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflected the launch of iPhone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the Company\u0092s ability to meet demand more quickly for iPhone 4s when compared to the iPhone 4 launch. Growth during the first\nhalf of 2012 was also favorably impacted by strong unit sales of iPad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in iPad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011. Partially offsetting these\npositive factors was a decrease in iPod net sales experienced across all operating segments. \nIn October 2011, the Company\nintroduced iPhone 4s and launched iCloud, the Company\u0092s cloud service that stores user data and keeps it up to date and available on multiple iOS devices and Mac and Windows personal computers. The Company introduced the third generation iPad\nwith Retina display in March 2012 and in June 2012 introduced the MacBook Pro with Retina display and an updated MacBook Air During the fourth quarter of 2012, OS X Mountain Lion was released and iPhone 5 was introduced. \nIn March 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that would be executed over three years and announced plans\nto initiate a quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter, the Company paid dividends of $2.5 billion or $2.65 per common share. \nThe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \nGreater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. \nIncludes deferrals and amortization of related non-software services and software upgrade rights. \nIncludes revenue from sales on the iTunes Store, the App Store, the Mac App Store, and the iBooks Store, and revenue from sales of AppleCare,\nlicensing and other services. \nIncludes sales of hardware peripherals and\u00a0Apple-branded and third-party accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod.\n\nThe Company\u0092s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period\u00a0that ends on the last\nSaturday of September.\u00a0The Company\u0092s fiscal years 2013,\u00a02012 and 2011 ended on September\u00a028, 2013,\u00a0September\u00a029, 2012 and September\u00a024, 2011, respectively.\u00a0Both fiscal years 2013 and 2011 spanned 52 weeks.\nFiscal year 2012\u00a0spanned 53 weeks, with a 14\n week\nadded to the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the Company\u0092s fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. Inclusion of the\u00a0additional week in 2012 increased\u00a0the Company\u0092s overall net\nsales and operating\u00a0expenses for the year.\nThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales\ninformation for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \nThe growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2013 resulted from increased demand for iPhone in\nall of the Company\u0092s operating segments primarily due to the launch of iPhone 5 beginning in September 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and 4s. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced increases in net sales and unit\nsales of iPhone during 2013 compared to 2012. The year-over-year impact of higher iPhone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iPhone average selling prices (\u0093ASPs\u0094) in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a\nshift in product mix towards lower-priced iPhone models, particularly iPhone 4. All of the Company\u0092s geographic operating segments experienced a decline in iPhone ASPs during 2013. \nThe year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iPhone in all of the Company\u0092s\noperating segments, except for the Rest of Asia Pacific segment. Growth in iPhone sales during 2012 is primarily a result of the launches of iPhone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and iPhone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand during\n2012 for iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS, and expanded distribution with new carriers and resellers. \nThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in\nthousands): \nThe growth in net sales and unit sales of iPad during 2013 resulted from growth in iPad unit sales in all\nof the Company\u0092s operating segments. This growth was driven by the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year growth rate of total iPad unit sales was significantly higher than\nthe growth rate of total iPad net sales for 2013 due to a reduction in iPad ASPs of 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. This decline resulted primarily from introduction of the lower priced iPad mini and the full year impact of the price reduction on iPad\n2 made in 2012. The decline in iPad ASPs was experienced to various degrees by all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. \nThe year-over-year increase in iPad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for iPad in all of the\nCompany\u0092s operating segments as a result of the launch of the third generation iPad in March 2012, continued demand for iPad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. The year-over-year growth rate of iPad unit sales was higher than the\ngrowth rate of iPad net sales during 2012 due to a 10% reduction in ASPs as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced iPad models, a price reduction on iPad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through\nthird-party resellers. \nThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \nMac net sales and unit sales for 2013 were down or relatively flat in all of the Company\u0092s operating\nsegments. Mac ASPs increased slightly partially offsetting the impact of lower unit sales on net sales. The decline in Mac unit sales and net sales reflects the overall weakness in the market for personal computers. \nThe year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects increased demand for Mac portables in all of the\nCompany\u0092s operating segments driven by 2012 releases of updated models of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, including MacBook Pro with Retina display in June 2012. Partially offsetting the increase in net sales of Mac portables was a decline in net\nsales of Mac desktops that reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. Additionally, the Company did not introduce updated versions of its Mac desktop products in 2012. \nThe following table presents net sales information of iTunes, software and services for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe increase in net sales of iTunes, software and services in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to\ngrowth in net sales from the iTunes Store, AppleCare and licensing. The iTunes Store generated a total of $9.3 billion in net sales during 2013, a 24% increase from 2012. Growth in the iTunes Store, which includes the App Store, the Mac App Store\nand the iBooks Store, reflects continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices, expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-App purchases, and expanded offerings of iTunes digital content. \nThe increase in net sales of iTunes, software and services in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to growth of the iTunes Store,\nwhich generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. The strong results of the iTunes Store in 2012 reflect growth of the App Store; growth of the Company\u0092s customer base; and the continued\nexpansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the iTunes Store. \nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its reportable operating segments,\nwhich are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes\nEuropean countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than those countries included in the\nCompany\u0092s other operating segments. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Company\u0092s geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company\u0092s operating segments may be found in Note 11, \u0093Segment Information and Geographic Data.\u0094 \nThe following table presents Americas net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe growth in the Americas segment net sales during 2013 was driven by increased sales of iPhone\nfollowing the introduction of iPhone 5 in September 2012 and iPhone 5s and 5c in September 2013, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of iPad, particularly iPad mini. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net\nsales of iPod and Mac and a decline in iPad ASPs. \nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased\ndemand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, and higher sales from the iTunes Store. \nThe following table presents Europe net sales information for 2013,\n2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nSimilar to the Americas segment, growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2013 was primarily\ndriven by increased sales of iPhone, iPad and higher net sales from iTunes. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod and a decline in iPad ASPs. Net sales in the Europe segment continue to be negatively\nimpacted by unfavorable economic conditions in parts of the region reflected by second half 2013 net sales falling 4% compared to the second half of 2012, which followed an 11% increase in net sales during the first half of 2013. \nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the\niTunes Store and increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4s. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in net sales in the\nEurope segment to the extent it did in other segments. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other geographic segments reflects growth in iPhone unit sales that was well below the\ngrowth rates experienced by the Company\u0092s other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in iPad unit sales. Net sales in the Europe \n\nsegment were also negatively impacted by the region\u0092s uncertain economic conditions and the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to several European currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe following table presents Greater China net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe growth in net sales in the Greater China segment during 2013 resulted from two major iPhone\nintroductions during the year, iPhone 5 in December 2012 and iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s in September 2013. Further contributing to the growth in 2013 was the introduction of the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini during the second quarter of 2013 and\nan increase in iPhone channel inventory as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012. While net sales in the China segment were up 13% for all of 2013, net sales for the second half of 2013 declined 4% compared to the second half of 2012.\n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iPhone following the launch of iPhone 4s and\nstrong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2. Growth in the Greater China segment was affected by the timing of iPhone and iPad product launches. iPhone 5 was not launched in China during 2012, and the third generation iPad that was\nintroduced by the Company in March 2012 was not launched in China until the fourth quarter of 2012. \nThe following table presents Japan net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe increase in net sales in the Japan segment during 2013 reflects significant increases in unit volumes\nof iPhone and iPad, strong growth of iTunes Store net sales and an increase in iPhone channel inventory as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012. These positive factors were partially offset by declines in ASPs for iPhone and iPad and by\nweakness in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. \nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by\nincreased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, expanded distribution with a new iPhone carrier, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store, and strength in the Japanese\nYen relative to the U.S. dollar. \nThe following table presents Rest of Asia Pacific net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe growth in net sales during 2013 was primarily driven by the launch of iPhone 5 and higher sales from\niTunes, partially offset by a decrease in net sales of iPad and Mac.\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to strong demand for the third generation\niPad. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced significantly lower year-over-year growth in net sales compared to all of the Company\u0092s other operating segments due primarily to a decrease in iPhone sales. This decrease reflects the timing\nof iPhone 5 launches in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment, which only occurred in a limited number of countries during the fourth quarter of 2012. \nThe following table presents Retail net sales information for 2013,\n2012 and 2011 (in millions, except for store counts): \nThe growth in net sales during 2013 was primarily driven by increased unit sales of iPhone and iPad\nfollowing the new product introductions in the first half of 2013 and increased sales of services. With an average of 403 and 365 open stores during 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $50.2 million in 2013, compared\nto $51.5 million in 2012. \nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iPhone following\nthe launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac net sales. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Retail segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other segments\nreflects the significant growth in iPad indirect distribution channel expansion. With an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3\nmillion in 2011. \nThe Retail segment\u0092s operating income was $4.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.1 billion during 2013,\n2012, and 2011, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in Retail operating income in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower gross margin similar to that experienced by the Company overall, partially offset by higher net sales. The year-over-year\nincrease in Retail operating income in 2012 is primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2012. \nGross margin for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in\nmillions, except gross margin percentages): \nThe gross margin percentage in 2013 was 37.6% compared to 43.9% in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in\ngross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing; a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins;\nintroduction of iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Company\u0092s average product margins; higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the Company\u0092s service policies and other\n\n\nwarranty costs; price reductions on certain products, including iPad 2 and iPhone 4; and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. \nThe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven\nby lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iPhone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The gross margin\npercentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. The primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iPhone sales and improved\nleverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. Additionally, gross margin in the second half\u00a0of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to\ncustomers,\u00a0price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs. \nThe Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. The foregoing statement regarding\nthe Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u0092s future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to those\nset forth above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety\nof factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins.\nIn response to competitive pressures, the Company expects\nit will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \nOperating expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as\nfollows (in millions, except for percentages): \nThe growth in R&D expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. Although\ntotal R&D expense increased 32% and 39% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and\ncompetitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to\nremain competitive. \nSelling, General and Administrative (\u0093SG&A\u0094) Expense \nThe growth in SG&A during 2013 was primarily due to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased\nheadcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional \n\nservices. The growth in SG&A during 2012 was primarily due to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on\nprofessional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the Company\u0092s net sales. \nOther income and expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011\nare as follows (in millions): \nThe year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest\nand dividend income resulting from the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter\nof 2013 and remeasurement losses from foreign exchange rate movements. The overall increase in other income and expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher interest and dividend income on the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%\nduring 2013 and 2012 and 0.77% during 2011. The Company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and 2011 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \nProvision for income taxes and effective tax\nrates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions): \nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates for all periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate\nof 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested\noutside the U.S. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary\ndifferences, tax losses, and tax credits of $4.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax\nplanning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by\nassessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance. \nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed\nits field audit of the Company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining\nthe years 2007 through 2012. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provisions have been\nmade for any \n\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in\na manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \nThe following table presents selected\nfinancial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September\u00a028, 2013,\u00a0September\u00a029, 2012 and September\u00a024, 2011 (in millions): \nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be\nsufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company anticipates the cash used for future\ndividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, $111.3 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign\nsubsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. \n holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company\u0092s\nmarketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade\nwith the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \nDuring 2013, cash generated from operating activities\nof $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion\nduring 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2013 consisted\nprimarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion. \nDuring 2012, cash generated from operating activities of $50.9 billion was a result of $41.7 billion of net income and non-cash\nadjustments to net income of $9.4 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $299 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2012 of $48.2 billion consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and\nmaturities of marketable securities of $38.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2012 of $1.7 billion consisted primarily of cash used to pay dividends and dividend\nequivalent rights of $2.5 billion. \nThe Company\u0092s capital expenditures were $7.0 billion during 2013, consisting of $499 million for retail store facilities and $6.5\nbillion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\u0092s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2013 were $8.2 billion.\n\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $11.0 billion for capital expenditures\nduring 2014, including approximately $550 million for retail store facilities and approximately $10.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure,\nincluding information systems hardware, software and enhancements. \nDuring 2014, the Company expects to open about 30 new\nretail stores, with approximately two-thirds located outside of the U.S. During 2014, the Company also expects to remodel approximately 20 of its existing stores. \nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0\nbillion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To manage the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate\nnotional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. Of the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion, $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due in 2018 through 2043. \nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company raised its cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common share each quarter,\nsubject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \nIn 2012, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors authorized a program to\nrepurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock. In April 2013, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been utilized as\nof September\u00a028, 2013. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 2015. The Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be\nrepurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. \nBeginning in August 2012 through December 2015, the Company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights, repurchase shares, and remit withheld\ntaxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, of which $37.1 billion had been utilized through September\u00a028, 2013. The following table presents the Company\u0092s dividends, share repurchases and net share settlement activity\nfor 2013 and 2012 since the start of the program (in millions): \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated\nretained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides\nfinancing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. \nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual\nobligations with minimum firm commitments as of September\u00a028, 2013 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for long-term debt (in millions): \nThe Company\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for\nterms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\nwere $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space. \nPurchase Commitments with Outsourcing\nPartners and Component Suppliers \nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the\nCompany\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150\ndays. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the\nCompany had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.6 billion. \nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments\nmentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of September\u00a028, 2013, that consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments\nrelated to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \nThe\nCompany\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company\nhad non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.7 billion and an additional $590 million for gross interest and penalties classified as\nnon-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above\ncontractual obligation table. \nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other\nagreements entered into by \n\nthe Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an\nindemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not\nrecord a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September\u00a028, 2013 or September\u00a029, 2012. \nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company\nhas agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal\nproceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. \nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its\nfinancial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u0094 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \nManagement\nbelieves the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated\npurchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and\nFinance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and\nsupport contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it\nhas been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the\nU.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware\nproducts, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The\n\n\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products,\n(ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware\nproduct\u0092s essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price\nto be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price\n(\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of\nelements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac\nand Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS\ndevices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the\nunspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided\nfor each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. \nThe Company\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves\nmanagement\u0092s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u0092s ESPs and the future\nrate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified\nsoftware upgrade rights, the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services, and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. \nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.\nFor transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been\nmet. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the\nestimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the\nCompany\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive\nprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a\ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \nThe Company\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities \n\nimpact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by\nspecific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the\nperiod any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes\nthereto; and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily\nimpaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. \nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees \nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing\nprocess equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The\nCompany records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed\nreview of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets\nand inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the\namount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. \nThe industries in which the Company competes are\nsubject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or\nmanufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u0092s product\ndevelopment plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company\u0092s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u0092s manufacturing process equipment\nor to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company\u0092s results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be\ncancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are\napplied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days.\nIf there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products, if the Company\u0092s product development plans change, or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the\nCompany\u0092s products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and\nknowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates \n\nthese estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as\nnecessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \nThe Company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial\nstatements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing\ntaxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to\nthe valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP\nand complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nNote 10, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies,\u0094 the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and\nthe amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company\nis subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the\nCompany sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and\neducation, enterprise and government customers. \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthese consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to\nthe current period\u0092s presentation. \nThe Company\u0092s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last\nSaturday of September. The Company\u0092s fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 ended on September\u00a028, 2013,\u00a0September\u00a029, 2012 and September\u00a024, 2011, respectively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\napproximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. Fiscal years 2013 and 2011 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. \nDuring the first quarter of 2013, the Company adopted amended accounting standards that changed the presentation of comprehensive income.\nThese standards increased the prominence of other comprehensive income (\u0093OCI\u0094) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders\u0092 equity and required the components of OCI to be\npresented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. The amended accounting standards only impacted the financial statement presentation of OCI and did not change the components that are\nrecognized in net income or OCI; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Company\u0092s financial position or results of operations. \nNet\nsales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has\noccurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales,\nthese criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because\nthe Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and\nthird-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the\n\n\nfollowing types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to\nthe functionality of the hardware. \nFor the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the\ngross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its\ncustomers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app\ndevelopers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.\nThis includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online\nstores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue\nfrom AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic\ntools offered under the Company\u0092s standard limited warranty. \nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated\ncommitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive\nprograms, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product\nreturns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the\nrelevant government authority. \nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables \nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the\nCompany uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093TPE\u0094), and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the\nCompany\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the\nCompany allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered. \nFor sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (\u0093iOS devices\u0094), Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades\nand features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and for Mac includes OS X and related applications. The Company\nalso provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. \n\nThe Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the\nfunctionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software\nupgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using\nthe relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is\nrecognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software,\nincluding estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses\nas incurred. \nThe Company\u0092s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple\nfactors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its\nqualifying hardware products. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or\nfeatures will be delivered. The Company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. Therefore, the\nCompany has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the selling prices would be relatively low. Key\nfactors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of Apple-branded and third-party Mac and iOS compatible software, the\nnature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the\nimpact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. When relevant, the\nsame factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs for offerings such as the non-software services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services. \nIn 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company\u0092s combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the\nnon-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. Beginning in September 2013, the combined ESPs for iPhone and iPad were increased by up to $5 to reflect additions to unspecified software upgrade rights\ndue to expansion of essential software bundled with these devices. Accordingly, the range of combined ESPs for iPhone and iPad as of September 2013 is $15 to $25. Beginning in October 2013, the Company anticipates increasing the combined ESPs for\nMac from $20 to $40 to reflect additions to unspecified software upgrade rights related to expansion of bundled essential software. Revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the\nrights are expected to be provided for each device, which ranges from two to four years. \nFor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company\u0092s\nshipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. \nThe Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty\nliabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or\notherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product\u0092s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company\u0092s products\nare released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2013, 2012 and 2011.\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $933 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011,\nrespectively. \nThe Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a)\u00a0equity instruments of the Company or (b)\u00a0liabilities that\nare based on the fair value of the enterprise\u0092s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (\u0093RSUs\u0094) is measured based on the closing\nfair market value of the Company\u0092s common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (\u0093stock purchase rights\u0094) is measured at the grant date and offering date,\nrespectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (\u0093BSM\u0094) option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest\nrates. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the award\u0092s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. The\nCompany recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders\u0092 Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on\nresearch and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u0093Benefit Plans\u0094 of\nthis Form 10-K. \nThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable\nincome in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be\nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, \u0093Income Taxes\u0094 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share\nis computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been\noutstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company\u0092s employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive\neffect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company\u0092s common stock can result in\na greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. \nThe following table shows the computation of basic and\ndiluted earnings per share for 2013, 2012, and 2011 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts): \nPotentially dilutive securities representing 4.2\u00a0million, 1.0\u00a0million and 1.7\u00a0million\nshares of common stock for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. \nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company\u0092s marketable debt and equity securities have been\nclassified and accounted for as \n Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the\ndesignations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u0092s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12\nmonths or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. The Company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or\nlong-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company\u0092s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a\ncomponent of shareholders\u0092 equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. \nThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. \nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative\ninstrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093AOCI\u0094) in shareholders\u0092 equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The\nineffective portion of the gain or \n\nloss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected\nfuture cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure\nto changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk\nare recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company had no fair value hedges in 2013, 2012 and 2011. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair\nvalue relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to\nfair value through current income. \nThe Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company\u0092s customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers\u0092 ability to pay. \nInventories\nare stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the \n method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which\nfor buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten\nyears for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $5.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion during 2013, 2012 and\n2011, respectively. \nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets \nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding\ngoodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their\ncarrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\nrecognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. The Company did not record any significant impairments during 2013, 2012 and 2011. \nThe Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested\nfor impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company\ndid not recognize any impairment charges related to \n\ngoodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for\nimpairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2013 and 2012, the Company\u0092s goodwill was allocated to the Americas and Europe reportable operating segments. \nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for\nimpairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods typically from three to seven years. \nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all\nfinancial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from\nselling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,\nthe Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in\nvaluation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy\nupon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: \n\u0096 Quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\u0096 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\nthe assets or liabilities. \n\u0096 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect\nmanagement\u0092s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nThe\nCompany\u0092s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by\nobservable market data. \nIn accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible\nfinancial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. \nThe Company translates the\nassets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those\nin effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders\u0092 equity. The Company\u0092s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency\nremeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant\nand have been included in the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n securities\u0092 adjusted cost, gross unrealized\ngains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short- or long-term marketable securities as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nThe net unrealized losses as of September\u00a028, 2013 and the net unrealized gains as of\nSeptember\u00a029, 2012 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit\ndeterioration and duration management. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the net realized gains recognized by the Company were not significant. The maturities of the Company\u0092s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.\n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, gross unrealized losses related\nto individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. \nAs of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013, the Company considered the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company\ntypically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the\npotential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and\nextent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be\nrequired to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment\u0092s cost basis. During 2013, 2012 and 2011 the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. \nThe Company uses derivatives to partially\noffset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net\ninvestments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities. \nTo help protect gross margins\nfrom fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional\ncurrency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u0092 functional currencies. The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. \nTo help protect the net investment\nin a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates. \nTo help protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into\ninterest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to offset a portion of the changes in income or expense due to fluctuations in interest rates. \nThe Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive\neconomic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. \nThe Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company\u0092s accounting treatment of these\ninstruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or \n instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in\nearnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. \nThe Company had net deferred losses of $175 million and $240 million associated with cash\nflow hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in\nthe same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred\ngains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The Company\u0092s hedged foreign\ncurrency transactions and hedged interest rate transactions as of September\u00a028, 2013 are expected to occur within 12 months and five years, respectively. \nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within\na subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are\nreflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during\n2013, 2012 and 2011. \nThe Company\u0092s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative\ntranslation adjustment account of AOCI, were not significant as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012. The ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other\nincome and expense. \nThe gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts\nnot designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset\na portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts. \nThe following table shows the notional principal amounts of the\nCompany\u0092s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nThe notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the\ntransaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company\u0092s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company\u0092s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that\nare outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on \n currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company\u0092s gross\nexposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency and interest rates. Although the\ntable above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company\u0092s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The\namounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. \nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce\ncredit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net\nfair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029,\n2012, the Company posted $164 million and $278 million, respectively, of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\u00a0The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September\u00a028, 2013 or September\u00a029, 2012. \nThe following tables show the Company\u0092s derivative instruments at gross fair value as reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nThe fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. \nThe fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. \nThe following table shows the pre-tax effect of the Company\u0092s derivative instruments\ndesignated as cash flow and net investment hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nIncludes gains/(losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, of which $44 million, $632 million and\n$(6) million were recognized within net sales, cost of sales and other income/(expense), net, respectively, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September\u00a028, 2013. \nIncludes gains/(losses) reclassified from AOCI into income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, of which $537 million and $70 million were\nrecognized within net sales and cost of sales, respectively, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September\u00a029, 2012. \nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,\nvalue-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to\nlimit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These\ncredit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which\naccounted for 13% and the other 10%. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. The Company\u0092s cellular network carriers\naccounted for 68% and 66% of trade receivables as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Company\u0092s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not\nsignificant. \nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final\nproducts for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company\u0092s vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15% of total non-trade receivables as of September\u00a028,\n2013 and vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company\u0092s vendors accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of September\u00a029, 2012. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and\ndoes not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. \nThe following tables show the Company\u0092s consolidated balance sheet details as of September\u00a028, 2013 and\nSeptember\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nThe following table shows the detail of other income and expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe Company\u0092s acquired intangible assets with\u00a0definite useful lives primarily consist of patents and licenses\nand are amortized over periods typically from three to seven years. The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nDefinite lived and amortizable acquired intangible assets\nDuring 2013 and 2012, the Company completed various business acquisitions. In 2013, the aggregate cash\nconsideration, net of cash acquired, was $496 million, of which $419 million was allocated to goodwill, $179 million to acquired intangible assets and $102 million to net liabilities assumed. In 2012, the aggregate cash consideration, net of cash\nacquired, was $350 million, of which $245 million was allocated to goodwill, $113 million to acquired intangible assets and $8 million to net liabilities assumed. \nThe Company\u0092s gross carrying amount of goodwill was $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, respectively. The Company did not have any goodwill\nimpairment during 2013, 2012 or 2011. \nAmortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $960 million, $605\nmillion and $192 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of September\u00a028, 2013 the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired intangible assets is 4.5 years. The expected annual amortization expense related to acquired\nintangible assets as of September\u00a028, 2013, is as follows (in millions): \nThe provision for income taxes for 2013, 2012 and 2011, consisted of the following (in millions): \nThe foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $30.5 billion, $36.8\nbillion and $24.0 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested\noutside the U.S. Substantially all of the Company\u0092s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate\nof 12.5%. As of September\u00a028, 2013, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $54.4 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be\napproximately $18.4 billion. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, $111.3 billion and $82.6 billion,\nrespectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. \n holdings. Amounts held by foreign\nsubsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. \nA reconciliation of the provision for\nincome taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2013, 2012 and 2011) to income before provision for income taxes for 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows (in millions): \nIndefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries\nThe Company\u0092s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan\nawards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the tax effect of the difference \n\nbetween the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the exercise price.\u00a0For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award\u0092s vesting equal\nto the tax effect of the underlying stock\u0092s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $643 million, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which were reflected as increases to\ncommon stock. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, the significant components of the Company\u0092s\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax\neffects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. \nTax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position\nwill be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest\namount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one\nyear as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the total amount of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits was $2.7 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company\u0092s effective tax rate. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889\nmillion, if recognized, would affect the Company\u0092s effective tax rate. \nThe aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes\ninterest and penalties, for 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows (in millions): \nIncreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\nDecreases related to expiration of statute of limitations\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for\nincome taxes. As of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $590 million and $401 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2013, 2012 and 2011 of $189 million, $140 million and $14 million, respectively. \nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign\njurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through\n2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2012. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state,\nlocal and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. \nManagement believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the\noutcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for\nincome tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by\nbetween $125 million and $225 million in the next 12\u00a0months. \nIn May 2013, the Company issued floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal\namount of $17.0 billion (collectively the \u0093Notes\u0094). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. \nThe principal amounts and associated interest rates of the Notes as of September\u00a028, 2013, are as follows: \nThe floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 bear interest at the three-month London InterBank\nOffered Rate (\u0093LIBOR\u0094) plus 0.05% and 0.25%, respectively. To manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0\nbillion designated as cash flow hedges of its floating-rate notes. These hedges effectively convert the floating interest rate on the floating-rate notes to a fixed interest rate. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the\ninterest rate swaps are recorded in OCI with a portion reclassified to interest expense each period to offset changes in interest rates on the floating-rate notes. The effective rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of\nthe discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $136 million of interest expense for the year ended September\u00a028, 2013. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for the\nCompany\u0092s Notes was $40 million. \nFuture principal payments for the Company\u0092s Notes as of September\u00a028, 2013,\nare as follows (in millions): \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the fair value of the Company\u0092s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was\n$15.9 billion. \nThe Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company\u0092s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors\nis authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company\u0092s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. \nThe Company declared and paid cash\ndividends per common share during the periods presented as follows: \nThe Company paid cash dividends of $2.65 per share, totaling $2.5 billion, during the fourth quarter of\n2012. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \nIn 2012, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors\nauthorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock beginning in 2013. In April 2013, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of\nwhich $23.0 billion had been utilized \n\nas of September\u00a028, 2013. The Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately\nnegotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094). \nIn August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (\u0093ASR\u0094) with a financial institution to purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock in\n2013. In the first quarter of 2013, 2.6\u00a0million shares were initially delivered to the Company. In April 2013, the purchase period for the ASR ended and an additional 1.5\u00a0million shares were delivered to the Company.\u00a0In total,\n4.1\u00a0million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $478.20 per share. The shares were retired in the quarters they were delivered, and the up-front payment of $1.95 billion was accounted for as a reduction to\nshareholders\u0092 equity in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the first quarter of 2013. \nIn April 2013, the\nCompany entered into a new ASR program with two financial institutions to purchase up to $12 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $12 billion, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares\nduring the ASR\u0092s purchase periods, which will end during 2014. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume\nweighted average price of the Company\u0092s stock during that period. During the third quarter of 2013, 23.5\u00a0million shares were initially delivered to the Company and retired. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered\nunder the ASR. The up-front payments of $12 billion were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\u0092 equity in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nThe Company reflected the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The forward contracts met all of the\napplicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments. \nDuring 2013,\nthe Company repurchased 19.4\u00a0million shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $464.11 per share for a total of $9.0 billion. These shares were retired upon repurchase. \nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income\nrefers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders\u0092 equity but are excluded from net income. The Company\u0092s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation\nadjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities\nclassified as available-for-sale. \nThe following table shows the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of September\u00a028,\n2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nNet unrecognized gains/losses on derivative instruments\nNet unrealized gains/losses on marketable securities\nThe 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \u00932003\nPlan\u0094) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation\nrights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment,\nwith either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u0092s common stock on a one-for-one\nbasis. Each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of\nan option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have dividend equivalent rights\n(\u0093DER\u0094), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DER are accumulated and paid\nwhen the underlying shares vest. As of September\u00a028, 2013, approximately 28.3\u00a0million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. \nThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the \u0093Director\nPlan\u0094) is a shareholder approved plan that (i)\u00a0permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company\u0092s non-employee directors, (ii)\u00a0provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director\njoining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii)\u00a0permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and\nannual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company\u0092s common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the\nnumber of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November\u00a09, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DER. As of September\u00a028, 2013, approximately 176,000 shares were\nreserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W. Schiller, Daniel\nRiccio and Jeffrey E. Williams and director William V. Campbell had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and\ndates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company\u0092s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company\u0092s employee and director equity plans. \nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u0093Purchase Plan\u0094) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company\u0092s common stock through payroll\ndeductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee\u0092s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the\nemployee\u0092s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September\u00a028, 2013, approximately 1.8\u00a0million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.\n\nThe Company\u0092s 401(k) Plan (the \u0093401(k) Plan\u0094) is a deferred salary arrangement under Section\u00a0401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees\nmay defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2013). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee\u0092s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the\nemployee\u0092s eligible earnings. The Company\u0092s matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $135 million, $114 million and $90 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \nA summary of the Company\u0092s RSU activity and\nrelated information for 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows: \nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $1.5 billion\nfor 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees\u0092 minimum statutory obligation for the applicable\nincome and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 2.2\u00a0million, 2.3\u00a0million and 1.6\u00a0million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u0092s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees\u0092 tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $520 million\nin 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\u00a0These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the\nnumber of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. \nA summary of the Company\u0092s stock option activity and related information for 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows: \nAggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company\u0092s closing stock price on the last\ntrading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.0 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion for 2013,\n2012 and 2011, respectively. \nThe Company granted 8,000 and 1,370 stock options during 2013 and 2011, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during 2013 and 2011 was $294.84 and\n$181.13, respectively. The Company did not grant any stock options during 2012. \nDuring 2013 and 2012, in conjunction with\ncertain business combinations, the Company assumed 29,000 and 41,000 stock options, respectively, which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $407.80 and $405.39, respectively. The Company did not assume any stock options during 2011.\n\n fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $115.19,\n$108.44 and $71.47 during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \nThe following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $816 million, $567 million and\n$467 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs was $4.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a\nweighted-average period of 3.0 years. \nThe Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The\nCompany also offers a \n basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company\u0092s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic\nlimited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection,\nhistorical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing\nwarranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. \nThe\nfollowing table shows changes in the Company\u0092s accrued warranties and related costs for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software\nagainst legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in\nthe event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified\nthird-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore,\nthe Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either September\u00a028, 2013 or September\u00a029, 2012. \nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent\npermitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such \n\nindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due\nto the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and\npayments made under these agreements historically have not been material. \nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials\nand Product \nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple\nsources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its\ncompetitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have\nmatured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company\u0092s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u0092s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\nquantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. \nThe Company has\nentered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant\nrisks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently\nperformed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\u0092s products. Although the Company works\nclosely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\u0092s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\u0092s purchase commitments\ntypically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. \nThe\nCompany leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are\ntypically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often\ncontain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space. \nRent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases,\nwas $645 million, $488 million and $338 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September\u00a028, 2013, are as follows (in\nmillions): \nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.6 billion. \nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and\ntelecommunications services and other obligations. \nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been\nfully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in\nexcess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \nApple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. \nOn August\u00a024,\n2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March\u00a01,\n2013, the District Court upheld $599 million of the jury\u0092s award and ordered a new trial as to the remainder. Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment, partial re-trial and\u00a0appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in\nits results of operations. \nOn August\u00a011, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four patents\nrelating to network communications technology. On November\u00a06, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded damages of $368 million. The Company is challenging the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded\na loss accrual at this time. \nThe Company reports segment information based on the \u0093management\u0094 approach. The management approach\ndesignates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\u0092s reportable segments. \nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u0092s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail\noperations. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia\nPacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than those countries included in the Company\u0092s other operating segments. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the\nCompany\u0092s geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those\ndescribed in Note 1, \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u0094 \nThe Company evaluates the performance of its\noperating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales through the Company\u0092s retail stores. Operating\nincome for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are\nincurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not\ninclude intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. \nSegment assets include receivables and\ninventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term\ninvestments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases\nfor long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $495\nmillion, $858 million and $612 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company\u0092s total depreciation and amortization was $6.8 billion, $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which $382 million, $319\nmillion and $273 million was related to the Retail segment in the respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant. \nThe following table shows information by operating segment for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in\nmillions): \nA reconciliation of the Company\u0092s segment operating income to the consolidated financial statements\nfor 2013, 2012 and 2011, is as follows (in millions): \nThe following table shows total assets by segment and a reconciliation to the consolidated financial\nstatements as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012 (in millions): \nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the\nCompany\u0092s net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2013, 2012 or 2011. Net sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011 and long-lived assets as of September\u00a028, 2013 and\nSeptember\u00a029, 2012 are as follows (in millions): \nChina includes Hong Kong. Long-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and assets\nrelated to retail stores and related infrastructure. \nInformation regarding net sales by product for 2013,\n2012 and 2011, is as follows (in millions): \nIncludes deferrals and amortization of related non-software services and software upgrade rights. \nIncludes revenue from sales on the iTunes Store, the App Store, the Mac App Store, and the iBooks Store, and revenue from sales of AppleCare,\nlicensing and other services. \nIncludes sales of hardware peripherals and\u00a0Apple-branded and third-party accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod.\n\nNote 12 \u0096 Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited) \nThe following tables show a summary of the Company\u0092s quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters\nof 2013 and 2012 (in millions, except per share amounts): \nBasic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and\ndiluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. \nREPORT OF ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, and\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u0092 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\u00a028, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the\nCompany\u0092s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. \nWe\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\nare free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029,\n2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\u00a028, 2013, in conformity with U.S.\u00a0generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple\nInc.\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2013, based on criteria established in \n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(1992 framework) and our report dated October\u00a029, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nREPORT OF ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. \nWe have audited Apple Inc.\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2013, based on criteria established in \n issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (\u0093the COSO criteria\u0094). Apple Inc.\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u0092s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u0092s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nA company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nIn our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2013 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October\u00a029, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

{"content": {"11": "Information required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section \u0093Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters\u0094 in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n", "1A": "If any\nof the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nIf our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful, our revenues will be adversely affected. \nWe must\ncontinue to attract subscribers to our service. Our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting, viewing, receiving and returning DVD\nand streaming titles, including providing valuable recommendations through our recommendation and merchandising technology. Furthermore, the relative service levels, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our\nability to attract subscribers. Competitors include DVD rental outlets and kiosk services, video package providers with pay-per-view and VOD content, online DVD subscription rental web sites, entertainment video retail stores and Internet movie and\nTV content providers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract subscribers. In addition, many of our subscribers are\nrejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing subscribers. If our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to attract subscribers, and as a result, our revenues will be\nadversely affected. \nIf we experience excessive rates of churn, our revenues and business will be harmed. \nWe must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers. Subscribers cancel their subscription to our service\nfor many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, delivery takes too long, the service is a poor value, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not\nsatisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base. If too many of our subscribers cancel our service, or if we are unable to attract\nnew subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, our operating results will be adversely affected. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new\nsubscribers, our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently\nanticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers. \nDeterioration in the economy could impact our business. \nNetflix is an entertainment service, and payment for our service may be considered discretionary on the part of many of our current and\npotential subscribers. To the extent the overall economy continues to deteriorate, such as in the case of a prolonged recession, our business could be impacted as subscribers choose either to leave our service or reduce their service levels. Also,\nefforts to attract new subscribers may be adversely impacted. \nIf the market segment for online DVD rentals saturates, our business will be\nadversely affected. \nThe market segment for online DVD rental has grown significantly since inception. Some of the\nincreasing growth can be attributed to changes in our service offering, especially the ability of our subscribers to stream movies and TV episodes on their TVs and computers. A decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for\nonline DVD rentals is beginning to saturate. While we believe that online DVD rentals will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, if this market segment were to saturate, our business would be adversely affected. \nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be adversely affected. \nThe market for in-home entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. New technologies for delivery of in-home\nentertainment video, such as VOD and Internet delivery of content, continue to receive considerable media and investor attention. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and\nsignificantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, programs and technologies, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be\nable to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability. \nSome of our competitors have adopted, and may continue\nto adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and Web site and systems development than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at\nour existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future. Furthermore, we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers and/or incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate. As a\nresult of increased competition, we may see a reduction in operating margins and market\u00a0share. \nIf VOD or other technologies are more\nwidely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery, our business could be adversely affected. \nSome digital cable\nproviders and Internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as VOD. This technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start, stop and rewind. In addition, other\ntechnologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment, particularly over the Internet and on devices such as cell phones. Although we are providing our own Internet-based\ndelivery of content, allowing our subscribers to stream certain movies and TV episodes, VOD or other technologies may become more affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery that are widely supported by studios and distributors and\nadopted by consumers. If this happens more quickly than we anticipate or more quickly than our own Internet delivery offerings, or if other providers are better able to meet studio and consumer needs and expectations, our business could be adversely\naffected. \nIf the popularity of the DVD format decreases, our business could be adversely affected. \nWhile the growth of DVD sales has slowed, we believe that the DVD will be a valuable long-term consumer proposition and studio profit center.\nHowever, if DVD sales were to decrease, because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of DVD enjoyment, studios and retailers may reduce their support of the DVD\nformat. Our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by the continued popularity of the DVD format, and if such popularity wanes, our subscriber growth may also slow. \nIf U.S. Copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the First Sale Doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on DVD in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects\nof the First Sale Doctrine, our business could be adversely affected. \nUnder U.S. Copyright Law, once a copyright owner\nsells a copy of his work, the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy. While the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work, the copyright owner gives up his\nability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold. As such, once a DVD is sold into the market, those obtaining the DVD are permitted to re-sell it, rent it or otherwise dispose of it. If Congress or the courts were to change or\nsubstantially limit this First Sale Doctrine, our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected. Likewise, if studios agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the\nFirst Sale Doctrine, our business could be adversely affected. For example, some studios have expressed a desire to delay the availability of new release DVDs for rental for a brief period of time following the DVDs release to the retail\n\n\nmarket and, in connection therewith, would prohibit certain of their wholesalers from selling to various rental outlets, such as us and Redbox. In fact, Universal Studios and Twentieth Century\nFox are engaged in litigation brought by Redbox over this practice. Furthermore, certain content owners, from time to time, have established exclusive rental windows with particular outlets. This happened in late 2006 and again in late 2007 when\nBlockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which Blockbuster would receive content on DVDs for rental exclusively by Blockbuster. To the extent content is to be distributed exclusively and not to retail vendors or\ndistributors, we could be prevented from obtaining such content. To the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors, we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the First Sale Doctrine.\nNonetheless, to the extent content owners do not distribute to us directly or through their wholesalers or otherwise establish exclusive rental windows, it will impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and, in some\ncases, in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand. If such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created, our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely\naffected. \nDelayed availability of new release DVDs for rental could adversely affect our business. \nWe recently entered into a licensing agreement with Warner Bros. whereby we agreed not to rent new release Warner Bros. DVDs until\ntwenty-eight days after such DVDs are first made available for retail sale. We believe that this agreement, and perhaps others like it, will provide us with less expensive content as well as deeper copy depth, thus improving both our business and\nconsumer experience. Nonetheless, it is possible that the delay in obtaining new release content both from Warner Bros. and any other suppliers that may adopt similar licensing strategies could impact consumer perception of our service or otherwise\nnegatively impact subscriber satisfaction. If this were to happen, our business could be adversely impacted. \nIf studios were to offer new\nreleases of entertainment video to other distribution channels prior to, or on parity with, the release on DVD, our business could be adversely affected. \nExcept for theatrical release, DVDs currently enjoy a competitive advantage over other distribution channels, such as pay-per-view and VOD, because of the early distribution window on the DVD format. The\nwindow for new releases on DVD is generally exclusive against other forms of non-theatrical movie distribution, such as pay-per-view, Internet delivery, premium TV, basic cable and network and syndicated TV. The length of the exclusive window for\nmovie rental and retail sales varies and the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title. Over the past several years, the major studios have shortened the\nrelease windows and several studios have released movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD. If other distribution channels were to receive priority over, or parity with, DVD and such practices are widely adopted, our subscribers might find these other\ndistribution channels of more value than our service and our business could be adversely affected. \nWe depend on studios and distributors\nto license us content that we can stream instantly over the Internet. \nStreaming content over the Internet involves the\nlicensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining DVD content. Our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and distributors licensing us\ncontent specifically for Internet delivery. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. If the studios and distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses, our\nability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected. Unlike DVD, streaming content is not subject to the First Sale Doctrine. As such, we are completely dependent on the studio or distributor providing us licenses in order to\naccess and stream content. Many of the licenses provide for the studios or distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service\ncan be withdrawn on short notice. For example, in December 2008, certain content associated with our license from the Starz Play service was withdrawn on short notice. In addition, the studios have great\n\n\nflexibility in licensing content. They may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content. For example,\nHBO licenses content from studios like Warner Bros. and the license provides HBO with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services, including Netflix. As such, Netflix cannot license certain Warner Bros. content for\ndelivery to its subscribers while Warner Bros. may nonetheless license the same content to transactional VOD providers. If we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that\nare acceptable to us, our ability to stream movies and TV episodes to our subscribers will be adversely impacted, and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted. During the course of our license relationship, various\ncontract administration issues can arise. To the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner, our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted. \nWe rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from Netflix to various devices. \nWe currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their PCs, Macs and other devices, including\nInternet-connected Blu-ray players and TVs, digital video players and game consoles. We intend to broaden our capability to instantly stream movies and TV episodes to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining\nexisting and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. Our agreements with our consumer electronics\npartners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us.\nFurthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices\u0092 performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer\ndissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If\npartners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted. \nIf we experience increased demand for titles which we are unable to offset with increased subscriber retention or operating margins, our operating results may be adversely affected. \nWith our unlimited plans, there is no established limit to the number of movies and TV episodes that subscribers may rent on DVD or watch\ninstantly. We are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber content usage. Such adjustments include new Web site features and merchandising practices, improvements in the technology that enable subscribers to instantly\nwatch movies and TV episodes, an expanded DVD distribution network and software and process changes. In addition, demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or\nshifts in consumer content watching. \nIf our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to\nan extent necessary to offset the effect of any increased operating costs associated with increased usage, our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, our subscriber growth and retention may be adversely affected if we attempt to\nalter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles. \nIf our\nsubscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to obtain and deliver more frequently, our expenses may increase. \nCertain titles cost us more to purchase or result in greater revenue sharing expenses, depending on the source from which they are obtained and the terms on which they are obtained. If subscribers select\nthese titles\n\n\nmore often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected, our revenue sharing and other content acquisition expenses could increase, and our gross margins could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, films released on Blu-ray and those released for streaming may be more expensive to obtain than in the standard definition DVD format. The rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain. If subscribers select\nthese formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing standard definition DVD format, our content acquisition expenses could increase, and our gross margins could be adversely affected. \nIf our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain\nsubscribers, and our operating results may be adversely affected. \nWe must continue to build and maintain strong brand\nidentity. To succeed, we must continue to attract and retain a large number of subscribers who have relied on other rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service. In addition, we may have to compete for subscribers against other\nbrands which have greater recognition than ours. We believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition, both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles, such as VOD. From time to\ntime, our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service, including among other things, our inventory allocation, delivery processing and service interruptions. Furthermore, third party devices that enable instant streaming of movies and TV\nepisodes from Netflix may not meet consumer expectations. To the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed, our brand may be adversely impacted. If our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not\nsuccessful, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected. \nIf we are unable to manage\nthe mix of subscriber acquisition sources, our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected. \nWe\nutilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers. We obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts, including paid search listings, banner ads, text links and permission-based e-mails, as\nwell as our active affiliate program. We also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service. In addition, we have engaged in various offline marketing programs, including TV and radio advertising, direct mail\nand print campaigns, consumer package and mailing insertions. We also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. We maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our\nservice and drive subscriber acquisition. We opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals. If we are unable to maintain or replace our\nsources of subscribers with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected. \nIf we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels, our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected. \nWe may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us,\nbecome cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business. If companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer be given access to such\nchannels. In addition, if ad rates increase, we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber. Laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels, including commercial e-mail and\ndirect mail. We may limit or discontinue use or support of e-mail and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive, which could affect our goodwill or brand. If the available\nmarketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected. \nIf we are not able to manage our growth, our business could be adversely affected. \nWe have expanded rapidly since we launched our Web site in April 1998. Many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we\nwere at a smaller scale of operations. Also, as we grow, we have implemented new systems and software to help run our operations. If we are not able to refine or revise our legacy systems or implement new systems and software as we grow, if they\nfail or, if in responding to any other issues related to growth, our management is materially distracted from our current operations, our business may be adversely affected. \nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our DVDs and to manage other aspects of our operations, including streaming of movies and TV episodes to our\nsubscribers, and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business. \nWe use complex\nproprietary and other technology to process deliveries and returns of our DVDs and to manage other aspects of our operations, including streaming of movies and TV episodes to our subscribers. We continually enhance or modify the technology used for\nour distribution operations. We cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers. Future enhancements and modifications\nto our technology could consume considerable resources. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of DVDs among our shipping centers or the streaming of movies and TV episodes to our subscribers in a timely and\nefficient manner, our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired. In addition, if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to\nretain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired. Also, any harm to our subscribers\u0092 personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. \nIf we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in\nthe U.S. mail system, we could lose subscribers, which could adversely affect our operating results. \nWe rely exclusively\non the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs from our shipping centers and to return DVDs to us from our subscribers. We are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs, including delays or disruptions\ncaused by inclement weather, natural disasters, labor activism, health epidemics or bioterrorism. Our DVDs are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the U.S. Postal\nService. The risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our DVDs. If the entities replicating our DVDs use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver\nDVDs to our subscribers, our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, increased breakage and theft rates for our DVDs will increase our cost of acquiring titles.\n\nIncreases in the cost of delivering DVDs could adversely affect our gross profit. \nIncreases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the\nincrease. The U.S. Postal Service increased the rate for first class postage on May\u00a012, 2008 to 42 cents and again in May 2009 to 44 cents. It is expected that the U.S. Postal Service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance\nwith the powers given the U.S. Postal Service in connection with the 2007 postal reform legislation. However, in October 2009, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it would not raise rates in 2010. The U.S. Postal Service continues to focus on\nplans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient. If the U.S. Postal Service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of first-class mail, including changes in size, weight or machinability qualifications of our DVD\nenvelopes, such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our DVDs, and our gross margin could be adversely affected. For example, the Office of Inspector General (\u0093OIG\u0094) at the U.S. Postal Service issued a\nreport in November 2007 recommending that the U.S. Postal Service revise the machinability qualifications for\n\n\nfirst class mail related to DVDs or to charge DVD mailers who don\u0092t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable. In addition, a by-mail game rental\ncompany filed a complaint with the Postal Regulatory Commission alleging that the U.S. Postal Service unreasonably discriminated against it in favor of Netflix and Blockbuster. To the extent this proceeding was to result in operational or regulatory\nchanges impacting our mail processing, our gross margins and business operations could be adversely affected. We do not anticipate any material impact to our operational practices or postage delivery rates arising from the OIG report or the\nproceeding. Also, if the U.S. Postal Service curtails its services, such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing Saturday delivery service, our ability to timely deliver DVDs could diminish, and our subscriber satisfaction could be\nadversely affected. \nStudios also release films in high definition format on Blu-ray. This high definition format DVD has\nhigher damage rates than we currently experience with standard definition DVDs. If we were to see a significant increase in the number of Blu-ray DVDs we ship or an increase in the percentage of Blu-ray DVDs our subscribers take and the damage rates\nremained higher than standard definition DVDs, our gross margins, profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected. \nIf we are\nunable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology, our business may suffer. \nOur proprietary\nrecommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers. We believe that in order for our recommendation and merchandising technology to function most\neffectively, it must access a large database of user ratings. We cannot assure that our recommendation and merchandising technology will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy, or that we\nwill continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles. \nWe are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers. We may experience difficulties in\nimplementing refinements. In addition, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology. \nIf our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements, our personal\nmovie recommendation service will be less useful, in which event: \nour subscriber satisfaction may decrease, subscribers may perceive our service to be of lower value and our ability to attract and retain subscribers\nmay be adversely affected; \nour ability to effectively merchandise and utilize our library will be adversely affected; and \nour subscribers may default to choosing titles from among new releases or other titles that cost us more to provide, and our margins may be adversely\naffected. \nIf we do not acquire sufficient DVD titles, our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be\nadversely affected. \nIf we do not acquire sufficient copies of DVDs, either by not correctly anticipating demand or by\nintentionally acquiring fewer copies than needed to fully satisfy demand, we may not appropriately satisfy subscriber demand, and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be adversely affected. Conversely, if we attempt to\nmitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand, our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be adversely affected. Our ability to accurately predict subscriber demand as\nwell as market factors such as exclusive distribution arrangements may impact our ability to acquire appropriate quantities of certain DVDs. \nIf we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms\nfavorable to us, or if the cost of obtaining titles on a wholesale basis increases, our gross margins may be adversely affected. \nWe obtain DVDs through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases. The type of agreement depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences. We have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements\nwith studios and distributors which typically enabled us to increase our copy depth of DVDs on an economical basis because of a low initial payment with additional payments made only if our subscribers rent the DVD. During the course of our revenue\nsharing relationships, various contract administration issues can arise. To the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner, our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be\nadversely impacted. \nAs the revenue sharing agreements expire, we must renegotiate new terms or shift to direct purchasing\narrangements, under which we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the DVD is rented. If we cannot renegotiate purchasing on favorable terms, the cost of obtaining content could increase and our gross margins may be adversely\naffected. In addition, the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase if we are required to directly purchase more titles.\nIf the sales price of DVDs to retail consumers decreases, our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected. \nThe cost of manufacturing DVDs is substantially less than the price for which new DVDs are generally sold in the retail market. Thus, we believe that studios and other resellers of DVDs have significant\nflexibility in pricing DVDs for retail sale. If the retail price of DVDs decreases significantly, consumers may choose to purchase DVDs instead of subscribing to our service. \nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business.\n\nSubscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our Web site or a Netflix Ready Device. Our reputation\nand ability to attract, retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. Interruptions in these systems, or with the Internet in\ngeneral, including discriminatory network management practices, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to fulfill DVD selections or deliver streaming content. For example, in August 2008, we suffered a service\ninterruption that impacted our ability to ship and receive DVDs as well as stream movies to our subscribers. Much of our software is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued\nperformance of our software and computer systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and\npotential subscribers. \nOur servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. Our Web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a\ndisruption in service. Any attempts by hackers to disrupt our service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks\non our Web site or internal systems. Efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services. In certain instances, we have voluntarily provided affected subscribers\nwith a credit during periods of extended outage. Any significant disruption to our service or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our\nfacilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. We recently have begun utilizing third-party Internet-based or \u0093cloud\u0094 computing systems in connection with our business operations. Also, we utilize third-party content delivery\nnetworks to help us stream movies and TV episodes in high volume to Netflix subscribers over the Internet. Fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or\ncause them to fail completely. As we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business. In addition, problems faced by our third party Web\nhosting, cloud computing, or content delivery network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers. \nIn the event of an earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster, our operations could be adversely affected. \nOur executive offices and data centers are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We have shipping centers located throughout the United States, including earthquake and hurricane-sensitive areas. Our\nbusiness and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins or similar events. We may not be able to\neffectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events. Because the San Francisco Bay Area is located in an earthquake-sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of\ndamage to, or total destruction of, our executive offices and data centers. We are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and\nexpenses from other natural disasters. \nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or\nunauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation. \nIn the ordinary course of\nbusiness and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendations, we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information.\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users\u0092 browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of\ndata utilization practices, including self-regulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose\ndata about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. \nOur reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized\npersons. \nWe maintain personal data regarding our subscribers, including names and mailing addresses. With respect to\nbilling data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers\u0092 data. If, despite these\nmeasures, we, or our payment processing service, experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers\u0092 data, current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers,\nwe could face legal claims, and our business could be adversely affected. Similarly, if a well-publicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer Web site were to occur, there could be a general public loss of confidence in\nthe use of the Internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business. \nIn addition, because we obtain\nsubscribers\u0092 billing information on our Web site, we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them. Under current credit card practices, to the extent we do not obtain cardholders\u0092 signatures,\nwe are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions, even when\n\n\nthe associated financial institution approves payment of the orders. From time to time, fraudulent credit cards are used on our Web site to obtain service and access our DVD inventory and\nstreaming. Typically, these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards. While we do have a number of other safeguards in place, we nonetheless experience some loss from\nthese fraudulent transactions. We do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions. A failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations.\n\nIncreases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations. \nOur subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit\ncards. Our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees. From time to time, these fees may increase, either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business\npractices which increase the fees on a cost-per-transaction basis. Such increases may adversely affect our results of operations. \nWe are subject to rules, regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods, which are predominately credit cards and debit cards. These rules, regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods, and our business and results of operations would be\nadversely affected. \nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our\ncompetitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. \nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret\nprotection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings. We have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these\napplications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights, and we may not be able to prevent\ninfringement without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able\nto more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely\naffected. \nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other\nthings, our Web site, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities. \nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our Web site. We use the\nintellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable\nto obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation\nof third party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant\n\n\nresources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet.\nWe have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of\ntechnical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current Web site or our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may\nhave to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms\nacceptable to us. \nIf we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected. \nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely\naffect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain\nnames in the United States may change in the near future. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to\nacquire or maintain relevant domain names. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to\nprevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. \nIf we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service, our results of operations would be adversely affected. \nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on\nthe nature and content of materials that we distribute. We also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our community-related content or movie reviews. If we become liable, then our business may suffer.\nLitigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations. We cannot assure that we are adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or\nliability that may be imposed on us. \nIf government regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business change or if\nconsumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses. \nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.\nIn addition, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new\ninterpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. \nThe manner in which Internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability, which in turn could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the Internet, including laws limiting Internet neutrality, could\ndecrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business. \nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a\nsignificant amount of our management\u0092s time and attention. \nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims\nthat could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. Most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits, which are typically\nexpensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of our management\u0092s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nChanges in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs. \nChanges in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and recently\nenacted rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we devote resources to their requirements. \nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders. \nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain\nadditional capital will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt\nsecurities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. \nWe issued $200 million in a debt offering and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2009, we have $200 million in 8.50% senior notes outstanding. Risks relating to our long-term indebtedness include:\n\nRequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to\nfund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; \nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; and\n\nLimiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable. \nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of\nindentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. \nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to\nmeet certain covenants. The failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us. \nThe\nagreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants, including those that restrict our ability to, among other things: \nBorrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees; \nPay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock; \nMake investments in entities that we do not control, including joint ventures; \nThese covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default\nunder those agreements. \nOur officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over Netflix. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2009, our executive officers and directors, their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 23% of our\noutstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days. In particular, Jay Hoag, one of our directors, beneficially owned approximately 14% and Reed Hastings, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board,\nbeneficially owned approximately 6%. These stockholders may have individual interests that are different from other stockholders and will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the\nelection of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. \nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they: \nauthorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\nprohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; \nestablish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and \nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. \nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Executive\nSeverance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business\ncombination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to\nprevent or delay an acquisition of us. \nThe price at which our common stock has traded since our May 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly. The price may\ncontinue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control: \nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\nannouncements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; \ncompetition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; \nthe level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and \nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price. \nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may\nexperience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u0092s attention and resources. \nWe record substantial stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of stock options and shares under our employee share purchase program that may\nhave a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future. \nOur stock-based compensation expenses\ntotaled $12.6 million, $12.3 million and $12.0 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect our stock-based compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods, which will have an adverse impact on our operating\nresults. The lattice-binomial model used to value our stock option grants and the black-scholes models used to value shares granted under our employee share purchase program both require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nprice volatility of the underlying stock. If facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future period\nexpenses may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments, our operating income, net income and net income per share. \nFinancial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in\npredicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, number of paying subscribers, number of DVDs shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies\ncould cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.

To achieve this\nobjective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well\nas our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized\ngains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2009, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of\nmaterial impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due\nto changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate\nlater rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December\u00a031, 2009, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the\nprevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage-backed securities. Approximately 52% of the portfolio is invested in government and agency\nissued securities. \nAt December\u00a031, 2009, we had securities classified as short-term investments of $186.0 million.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. \nA sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment\nportfolio as of December\u00a031, 2009.\u00a0The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.\u00a0This\nmethodology\u00a0assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment. \nThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values (in $ thousands) of our debt\nsecurities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (\u0093BPS\u0094), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.\u00a0The analysis is shown as of December\u00a031, 2009: ", "10": "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance \nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections \u0093Proposal One: Election of Directors,\u0094 \u0093Section\n16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance\u0094 and \u0093Code of Ethics\u0094 in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

", "9B": "", "1": "With more than\n12\u00a0million subscribers, we are the world\u0092s largest subscription service streaming movies and TV episodes over the Internet and sending DVDs by mail. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and TV episodes streamed to their TVs\nand computers and can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes. We offer a variety of subscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. Aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandising\ntechnology, subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched instantly and a vast array of titles on DVD. On average, approximately 2\u00a0million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the United\nStates. Additionally, more than 48% of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009. \nWatch streaming content without commercial interruption on their computers and TVs. The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled software\nthat can run on a variety of consumer electronics devices (\u0093Netflix Ready Devices\u0094). These Netflix Ready Devices currently include Blu-ray disc players, Internet-connected TVs, digital video players and game consoles.\n\nReceive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next\navailable DVD in a subscriber\u0092s queue. \nOur core strategy is to grow a large subscription business\nconsisting of streaming and DVD-by-mail content. By combining streaming and DVD as part of the Netflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates a\ncompetitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed our\nother advantages such as brand, distribution, and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despite the growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that the standard definition DVD, along with its high definition successor, Blu-ray\n(collectively referred to as \u0093DVD\u0094), will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of\ncontent to the home will surpass DVD as the primary means by which most Netflix subscribers view content. \nWe promote our\nservice to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, TV and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. We also engage\n\n\nour consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end of\nthe free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced\nby the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. \nWe use our\nproprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber. In doing so, we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while\nalso effectively managing our inventory utilization. Our merchandising efforts are used throughout our web site and as part of the user interface on many Netflix Ready Devices to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers, including the\ngeneration of lists of similar titles. We believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization. \nWe obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios, distributors and other suppliers. DVD content is typically obtained through direct purchases or\nrevenue sharing agreements. Streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement. \nWe\nship and receive DVDs throughout the United States and maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers. We also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us\nefficiently stream movies and TV episodes in high volume to Netflix subscribers over the Internet. \nWe are focused on growing\nour subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to minimize variable and fixed operating costs within the framework of providing a valuable and compelling user experience. Our technology is\nextensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run\nour fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements. \nWe are organized in a single operating\nsegment. We currently generate all our revenues in the United States, although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription\nfees. We have no long-lived assets outside the United States. \nWe operate in the subscription segment of the in-home entertainment video market. In 2007, we expanded our DVD-by-mail distribution model to\ninclude streaming content over the Internet. This hybrid distribution model expands the consumer appeal of the Netflix subscription service beyond the traditional reach of the DVD rental segment and offers subscribers a uniquely compelling selection\nof content, both streaming and DVD, for one low monthly price. While the consumer appeal of this hybrid service has grown quickly, the market for Internet delivered video content is still in its formative stages, and we expect competition to be\nintense. \nCurrently the market for Internet delivered video consists of three market segments: video-on-demand\n(\u0093VOD\u0094), ad supported, and subscription. The VOD segment includes competitors like Amazon, Apple, Blockbuster, Cinemanow and Microsoft. The ad supported segment includes competitors like Hulu and YouTube. Currently, Netflix is the primary\nprovider in the subscription segment, but we expect direct and indirect competition to emerge and continue to grow as the consumer appeal for Internet delivery of video continues to expand. \nThe market for in-home entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous\nrelationships with multiple in-home entertainment video providers and can\n\n\neasily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to cable, rent a DVD from Redbox or Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon, download a movie from\nApple iTunes, watch a TV show on Hulu.com, and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. New competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost. DVDs and Internet delivery of content represent\nonly two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video. In addition, the growth in adoption of DVD and Internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies. \nDVD rental outlets and kiosk services, such as Blockbuster, Movie Gallery and Redbox; \nvideo package providers with pay-per-view and VOD content including cable providers, such as Time Warner and Comcast; direct broadcast satellite\nproviders, such as DIRECTV and Echostar; and telecommunication providers such as AT&T and Verizon; \nonline DVD subscription rental web sites, such as Blockbuster Online; \nentertainment video retail stores, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com; and \nInternet movie and TV content providers, such as Apple\u0092s iTunes, Amazon.com, Hulu.com and Google\u0092s YouTube. \nMotion pictures, including movies and TV episodes (\u0093entertainment video\u0094) are distributed broadly through a variety of channels, including movie theaters, airlines, hotels and in-home. In-home\ndistribution channels include DVD rental, retail outlets and web sites, Internet delivery and cable, satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium TV, pay-per-view and VOD. Currently, studios distribute movies approximately\nthree to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, three to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to premium TV and two to three years after theatrical release to basic\ncable and network TV. Internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as pay-per-view or VOD. However, some content, such as TV episodes, are often made available for Internet viewing shortly after the original airing date.\nThe major studios and TV networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows, and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows, including releasing movies\nsimultaneously on DVD and VOD. \nWe believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths: \n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Netflix has been highly rated in online retail customer satisfaction by independent surveys from Nielsen Online and in every one of the ten consecutive surveys\nconducted by ForeSee/FGI Research. Because of the high level of consumer satisfaction with Netflix, over 90 percent of surveyed subscribers say that they would recommend the Netflix service to a friend. We believe that these high levels of customer\nsatisfaction and brand loyalty make it expensive and difficult for competitors to displace Netflix as a subscription segment leader. \n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We utilize various tools, including our proprietary recommendation technology, to create a custom interface for each subscriber. We believe that this customization enhances the user\nexperience by helping Netflix subscribers discover great movies. Subscribers rate titles through our service, and our recommendation technology compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each\nsubscriber, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy. These predictions, along with other factors, are used to help merchandise titles to\n\n\nsubscribers. We believe that our recommendation technology and our other merchandising practices allow us to create broad-based demand for our library and maximize utilization of our library. By\ncreating demand for content, we seek to cost-effectively balance subscriber demand between newer, more expensive titles, and older, less expensive titles. Our ability to generate demand for these older, or \u0093long-tail,\u0094 titles while\nmaintaining high levels of customer satisfaction helps us manage and maintain our gross margin, subscriber acquisition cost, churn rate and lifetime subscriber profit. To that end, approximately 70% of the DVDs shipped during 2009 were titles with\nDVD release dates greater than 13 weeks. \nWe have achieved a level of scale in our\nbusiness that provides many operational and competitive advantages. From an operational perspective, for example, we are able to cost effectively automate many of our shipping and receiving processes, helping to drive down unit shipping costs while\nalso providing a better, more consistent experience to our subscribers. Such scale economies also have contributed over time to expanding operating margins which has made it possible for Netflix to aggressively price its service offering at levels\ndifficult for competition to meet. \nSubscribers can\nconveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site or by selecting titles directly from select Netflix Ready Devices. We create a unique experience for subscribers by generating user interfaces on our\nWebsite and Netflix Ready Devices that are tailored to subscribers\u0092 individual rental and ratings history. Subscribers rate approximately 20\u00a0million movies a week and Netflix has recorded more than 3 billion ratings to date. Based on each\nsubscriber\u0092s queue, we ship DVDs by first class mail and subscribers return these DVDs to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail our subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have a vast\narray of titles on DVD and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. In addition, subscribers can select from a growing number of titles that can be watched instantly on their computers or TVs without\ncommercial interruption. The number of streaming content choices has grown approximately 30% over the year ended December\u00a031, 2009 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future. \nOur core\nstrategy to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and DVD-by-mail content includes the following key elements: \nFor a low fixed monthly fee, we provide subscribers access to a growing library of movies and TV episodes that can be watched instantly and a vast selection of DVD\ntitles. We quickly deliver DVDs to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail. Subscribers can, at no additional fee, also stream movies and TV episodes to their computers and TVs. There are no due dates,\nno late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. We merchandise titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. Our recommendation and merchandising technology provides subscribers with\nindividualized recommendations of titles from our library. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing. \nUtilizing technology to enhance subscriber experience and operate efficiently.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe utilize proprietary and other\ntechnology to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers and the delivery of streaming content over the Internet. Our software and equipment automate the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of our\nshipping centers and allocate order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We\noperate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop this network to meet the demands of our operations. We also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and TV episodes in high volume to\nNetflix subscribers over the Internet. \nBuilding mutually beneficial relationships with entertainment video\nproviders.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various entertainment video providers. We maintain an\n\n\noffice in Beverly Hills, California in order to maintain effective working relationships with the major studios. We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license\nagreements. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and TV\nepisodes, as well as niche titles and programs. \nExpanding the number of devices capable of streaming video from\nNetflix\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have engaged a number of consumer electronics partners to offer instant streaming of content from Netflix to various devices. We currently offer subscribers the ability to stream content through their computers\nand other devices, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation3, Internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players, TiVo, and the Roku video digital player. We intend to broaden our partner relationships over time so that more devices, such as the Nintendo Wii\ngame console, are capable of streaming content from Netflix. By providing consumers with a broad array of devices capable of streaming content from Netflix, we believe that we enhance the value of our service to subscribers as well as position\nourselves for continued growth as the Internet delivery of content becomes more popular. \nWe apply substantial resources to develop and maintain technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription account\nsignup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and streaming content. We believe that our Web site provides our subscribers with an easy-to-use interface that enhances the value of our service. We believe that our\nability to personally merchandise our content through the Web site optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation and merchandising technology, each subscriber\u0092s current\nqueue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment\nmethods. Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs, as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively,\nincluding testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing. \nWe use our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology along with other data to determine which titles are presented to a\nsubscriber. In doing so, we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while also effectively managing our inventory utilization. Our merchandising efforts are used throughout\nour web site to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers, including the generation of lists of similar titles. We believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization.\n\nWe also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they\nwill enjoy. This information may include: \nfactual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats; \nmovie trailers and other editorial perspectives, including plot synopses and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix\nsubscribers; and \ndata from our recommendation and merchandising technology, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy.\n\nWe use multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring subscribers. We advertise our service online through such\nvehicles as paid search listings, banner ads, text links and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program\n\n\nwhereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also engage our\nconsumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service. We also advertise our service on various regional and national TV and radio stations. We use targeted, solo direct mail, shared mail and newspaper print advertising to\nacquire new subscribers. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studios movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We\nbelieve that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. \nWe obtain content through direct purchases, revenue\nsharing agreements and license agreements. Under our DVD and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for a defined period of time either to\nshare a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization. After the revenue sharing period expires for a DVD, we generally have the option of returning the DVD to the studio, destroying the DVD or purchasing the\nDVD. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. We also purchase DVDs from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. Under these\narrangements, we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the DVDs we purchase. For titles that are streamed to our subscribers, we generally license the content directly from studios and distributors for a defined period of time. Following\nexpiration of the license term, we remove the content from our service unless we extend or renew the associated license agreement. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the\ntechnology that helps us manage fulfillment and the integration of our web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels, content delivery networks and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDs\nfrom a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the customer experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal\nService. We also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and TV episodes in high volume to our subscribers over the Internet. \nWe believe that our ability to establish and maintain\nlong-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. As such, we work on maintaining and improving the overall quality and level of customer service and support we provide to our\nsubscribers. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon, and primarily handles subscriber inquiries by telephone. In addition, we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain\nself-service features on our web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. \nAs of\nDecember\u00a031, 2009, we had 1,883 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December\u00a031, 2009, we had 2,197\npart-time and temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. \nWe use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright\nand trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. While our patents\n\n\nare an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents. We have registered trademarks and service marks for the\nNetflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business\nmethods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. \nOur ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily\non proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. \nFrom time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure that we will prevail\nin any intellectual property dispute.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002.

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including\nprice, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. Under this program, the Company repurchased 3,197,459 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $47 per share for an\naggregate amount of $149 million. \nOn January\u00a026, 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a\nstock repurchase program for 2009. Under this program, the Company repurchased 4,173,855 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $42 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $175 million.

Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and TV episodes streamed to their TVs and computers and can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes. We offer a variety of\nsubscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. Aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology, subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched\ninstantly and a vast array of titles on DVD. On average, approximately 2\u00a0million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the United States. Additionally, more than 48% of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15\nminutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009. \nWatch streaming content without commercial interruption on their computers and TVs. The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled software\nthat can run on a variety of consumer electronics devices (\u0093Netflix Ready Devices\u0094). These Netflix Ready Devices currently include Blu-ray disc players, Internet-connected TVs, digital video players and game consoles.\n\nReceive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next\navailable DVD in a subscriber\u0092s queue. \nOur core strategy is to grow a large subscription business\nconsisting of streaming and DVD-by\u0096mail content. By combining streaming and DVD as part of the Netflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates a\ncompetitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed our\nother advantages such as brand, distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despite the growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that the standard definition DVD, along with its high definition successor, Blu-ray\n(collectively referred to as \u0093DVD\u0094), will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of\ncontent to the home will surpass DVD as the primary means by which most Netflix subscribers view content. \nThe following represents our performance highlights for 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands, except for per share amounts, percentages and\nsubscriber acquisition costs): \nChurn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber addition, then divided by\nthree months. Churn (annualized) is the average of Churn for the four quarters of each respective year. \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u0093SEC\u0094) has defined a company\u0092s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a\ncompany\u0092s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed\nbelow. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \nWe obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios, distributors, and other suppliers. DVD content is obtained through direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements. Streaming content\nis generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement but may also be obtained through a revenue sharing agreement. \nWe acquire DVD content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues, and, as such, we consider our direct purchase DVD library to be a productive asset.\nAccordingly, we classify our DVD library as a non-current asset on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, cash outflows for the acquisition of the DVD library, net of changes in related accounts payable, are classified as cash flows from\ninvesting activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. This is inclusive of any upfront non-refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements. \nWe amortize our direct purchase DVDs, less estimated salvage value, on a \u0093sum-of-the-months\u0094 accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of the new-release DVDs and\nback-catalog DVDs is estimated to be one year and three years, respectively. In estimating the useful life of our DVDs, we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged DVDs. For those direct purchase DVDs that we\nestimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives, a salvage value is provided. For those DVDs that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. We periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our DVDs. \nAdditionally, the terms of certain DVD direct purchase agreements with studios and\ndistributors provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels. Volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of DVD library when earned. We accrue for rebates as earned based on historical\ntitle performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term. \nWe obtain content distribution\nrights in order to stream movies and TV episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers\u0092 computers and TVs via Netflix Ready Devices. We account for streaming content in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u0092s\n(\u0093FASB\u0094) Accounting Standards Codification (\u0093ASC\u0094) topic 920 \n. Cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. \nWe classify our streaming content obtained through a license agreement as either a current or\nnon-current asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met, including availability of the streaming content for its first showing. We amortize licensed streaming content on a\nstraight-line basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the title\u0092s window of availability. \nWe\nalso obtain DVD and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors. We generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee,\nbased on utilization, for a defined period of time, or the Title Term, which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title. The initial cost may be in the form of an upfront non-refundable payment. This payment is capitalized in the\ncontent library in accordance with our DVD and streaming content policies as applicable. The initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense. The terms\nof some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles. We amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments (or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears) as\nrevenue sharing obligations are incurred. A provision for estimated shortfall, if any, on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Under the revenue sharing\nagreements for our DVD library, at the end of the Title Term, we generally have the option of returning the DVD to the studio, destroying the DVD or purchasing the DVD. \nStock-based compensation expense is\nestimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. \nWe calculate the fair value of new stock-based compensation awards under our stock option plans using a lattice-binomial model. We use a\nBlack-Scholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares. These models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the subjective input assumptions\ncan materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted. \nOur computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common\nstock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. Our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock\nis more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. \nOur computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise\nbehavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted and is determined for both executives and non-executives. \nWe grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non-qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based\ncompensation\n\n\nexpense is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. We also issue shares through our employee stock purchase program (\u0093ESPP\u0094)\nwhich has been determined to be compensatory in nature. Stock-based compensation expense for shares issued under this program is expensed over the offering period of six months. \nOur stock-based compensation expenses totaled $12.6 million, $12.3 million and $12.0 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a\nresult of changes in our compensation structure and related employee elections for 2010 resulting in an increase in the number of options granted to employees, we expect our stock-based compensation expense for 2010 and future periods will increase\nsignificantly. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about stock based compensation. \nWe record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset\nand liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases\nand operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if\nnecessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. \nWe may recognize the tax\nbenefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial\nstatements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See\nNote 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. \nIn evaluating our ability to\nrecover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and\nfeasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the\ndeferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets\nwould be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. \nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below\nshould be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\u00a08, \nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscriber\u0092s monthly subscription period. We record refunds to\nsubscribers as a reduction of revenues. We currently generate all our revenues in the United States, although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010. \nWe offer a variety of subscription plans combining streaming movies and TV episodes over the Internet and sending DVDs by mail. The price\nper plan varies based on the number of DVDs that a subscriber has out at any given point and based on whether the service has limited or unlimited usage. All of our unlimited plans allow the subscriber unlimited streaming to their computer or\nNetflix Ready Device. The vast majority of our subscriber base has chosen a 1, 2 or 3-out Unlimited plan. Customers electing access to the high definition Blu-ray discs in addition to standard definition DVDs pay a surcharge ranging from $1 to $4\nfor our most popular plans. Pricing of our plans is as follows: \n(in thousands, except percentages and average monthly\nThe $305.6\nmillion increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 26.6% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and DVDs by mail for one low price and\nother benefits of our service. This increase was offset in part by a 3.3% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans. The total number of average paying\nsubscribers in our 1 and 2-out plans grew by 48.1% as compared to a 1.1% decline in all other plans during the year ended December\u00a031, 2009. \n(in thousands, except percentages and average monthly\nThe $159.3\nmillion increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 23.1% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and DVDs by mail for one low price and\nother benefits of our service. This increase was offset in part by an 8.0% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans, as well as a price reduction for our\nmost popular subscription plans during the third quarter of 2007. The total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2-out plans grew by 39.8% as compared to 6.1% in all other plans during the year ended December\u00a031, 2008. \nUntil the average price paid by our new subscriber additions is equal to the average price paid by existing subscribers, we expect our\naverage monthly revenue per paying subscriber will continue to decline, as the lower priced plans grow as a percentage of our subscriber base. This decline could be partially offset by the growth in the number of subscribers electing to receive\nBlu-ray discs for a surcharge as described above. Our revenues and average monthly revenue per paying subscriber could be impacted by future changes to our pricing structure which may result from competitive effects that we are unable to predict.\n\nThe following table presents our year-end subscriber information: \nCost of subscription revenues consists of\ncontent delivery costs related to shipping DVDs and providing streaming content to subscribers as well as expenses related to the acquisition of content. Costs related to free-trial periods are allocated to marketing expenses. \nContent delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our paying subscribers, the packaging and label costs for\nthe mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the Internet. We utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the Internet. \nContent acquisition expenses consist of costs incurred in obtaining content such as amortization of content and revenue sharing expense. We\nobtain content from studios, distributors and other suppliers through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements. \nThe $148.3 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors:\n\nContent delivery expenses increased $101.7 million primarily due to an 18.6% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase\nin the number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 26.6% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our\nlower priced plans. \nContent acquisition expenses increased by $46.6 million. This increase was primarily attributable to investments in streaming content.\n\nThe $96.7 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors:\n\nContent delivery expenses increased $72.7 million primarily due to a 19.0% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase in\nthe number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 23.1% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 3.2% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our lower\npriced plans. The increase is also due to an increase in the rates of first class postage in May 2008. \nContent acquisition expenses increased by $24.0 million This increase was primarily attributable to the increased investments in streaming content, as\nwell as an increase in DVD revenue sharing costs. \nFulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers, including costs\nattributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing our content library. Fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees. \nThe $20.7 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: \nShipping and customer service centers expenses increased $10.5 million primarily due to a 14.0% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of\ncontent delivery and growth in subscribers. \nCredit card fees increased $10.2 million as a result of the 22.4% growth in revenues. \nThe $27.3 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: \nShipping and customer service centers expenses increased $22.0 million primarily due to a 29.8% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of\ncontent delivery and the addition of new shipping centers. \nCredit card fees increased $5.3 million as a result of the 13.2% growth in revenues. \nThe 2.1%\nincrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower DVD content acquisition expenses per DVD mailed and a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. This decline was\nhigher than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 3.3%. This was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content. \nThe 1.5%\ndecrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective May 2008 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second half of 2007. \nWe expect to continue to make substantial investments in our content library and in\nparticular may increase spending associated with streaming content. These investments would reduce our gross margin to the extent that increases outpace growth in our revenues. \nTechnology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in testing, maintaining and modifying our Web site, our\nrecommendation and merchandising technology, developing solutions for streaming content to subscribers, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal-use software systems. Technology and development expenses also include\ndepreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our Web site and store our data. \nThe $24.7 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a\n$17.4 million increase in personnel-related costs due to 26.6% growth in headcount to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service. The increase is also partly due to a $6.7 million increase in facilities and\nequipment expenses to support the increased headcount and overall growth of operations. \nThe $18.9 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a\n$10.4 million increase in personnel-related costs due to 28.0% growth in headcount and an $8.5 million increase in other expenses to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service. \nMarketing\nexpenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates including consumer electronics partners. Advertising expenses include marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities, including allocated costs\nof revenues relating to free trial periods. Also included in marketing expense are payroll related expenses. \nThe $38.0\nmillion increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $21.4 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners. The increase is also due to an\n\n\n$11.5\u00a0million increase in marketing program spending, principally in TV and radio advertising and direct mail to promote our hybrid service of streaming content and DVDs by mail. Subscriber\nacquisition cost decreased primarily due to momentum associated with the launch of new consumer electronics partner devices and the broad appeal of streaming content. \nThe $18.5\nmillion decrease in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a $34.2 million decrease in marketing program spending, principally in direct mail and inserts, offset partially by an increase of $11.5 million in spending related to affiliates\nincluding our consumer electronics partners. In the second half of 2007, we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing\nprograms. The decrease was partially offset by higher personnel-related costs due to higher headcount and an increase in the costs of free trial periods due to the 28.4% increase in gross subscriber additions. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased\nin 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative\npersonnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. \nThe $1.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a\n$7.4 million increase in legal costs offset partially by a $2.7 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, a $2.1 million release of accruals in 2009 associated with a former class action suit that was settled\nin 2008, and decreases in personnel-related costs. \nThe $2.7 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a\n$2.6 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, as well as a $3.2 million decrease in legal costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs due to a 9.6% increase in\nheadcount. \nGain on disposal of DVDs represents the difference between proceeds from sales of DVDs and associated cost of DVD sales. Cost of DVD sales\nincludes the net book value of the DVDs sold, shipping charges and, where applicable, a contractually specified fee for the DVDs that are subject to revenue sharing agreements. \nThe $1.8 million decrease in gain on disposal of DVDs was primarily attributable to the\ndiscontinuation of retail sales of previously viewed DVDs to subscribers in the first quarter of 2009. We continue to sell previously viewed DVDs through wholesale channels and expect our future gains to continue to be insignificant in relation to\nour overall operations. \nThe $0.9 million decrease in gain on disposal of DVDs in absolute dollars was primarily\nattributable to a decrease in the sales price of DVDs. \nOn June\u00a025, 2007, we resolved a pending patent litigation with Blockbuster, Inc. As part of the settlement, we received a one-time\npayment of $7.0 million during the second quarter of 2007. \nInterest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 8.50% senior notes including the\namortization of debt issuance costs. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit. \nIn June 2004 and June 2006, we entered into two separate lease arrangements whereby we leased a building that was constructed by a third party. As discussed in Note 5 of the consolidated financial\nstatements, we have accounted for these leases in accordance with ASC topic 840.40 \n as it applies to situations in which an entity is involved with the construction funding of an asset that will be\nleased when the construction project is completed. This guidance requires Netflix to be considered the owner (for accounting purposes) of the two buildings. \nAccordingly, we have recorded assets on our balance sheet for the costs paid by our lessor\nto construct our headquarters facilities, along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor-paid construction costs. The monthly rent payments we make to our lessor under our lease agreements are recorded in our\nfinancial statements as land lease expense and principal and interest on the financing liabilities. Interest expense on lease financing obligations reflects the portion of our monthly lease payments that is allocated to interest expense. \nThe $4.0 million increase in interest expense is entirely attributable to the interest expense\nassociated with our 8.50% senior notes and line of credit. Interest expense in 2009 includes $2.8 million for our lease financing obligations, $2.6 million of interest payments due on our notes and $1.1 million of amortization of debt issuance\ncosts. \nThe $1.3 million increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the interest on our lease\nfinancing obligations arising when the lease term for the second of our headquarter buildings commenced. \nInterest and other income (expense) consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from\ninvested cash and short-term investments. \nThe $5.7 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to lower cash\nand investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock, and a $1.6 million decrease in realized gains recognized as compared to the prior year. The decrease was offset by a $1.8 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of\nour investment in a private company which we accounted for under the cost method. \nThe $7.9 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily a result of the lower cash\nand investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock. The decrease was offset by a $2.4 million increase in realized gains. \nInterest and dividend income was approximately $3.7 million, $9.2 million and $19.7 million\nin 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest and other income included gains of approximately $1.5 million, $3.1 million and $0.7 million on the sale of short-term investments in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. \nIn 2009, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to\nstate income taxes of $10 million or 5% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by Federal and California research and development (\u0093R&D\u0094) tax credits of $2 million. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily\nattributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period R&D tax credits. \nIn 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to\nstate income taxes of $5 million or 4% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by R&D tax credits of $3 million. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item\nin the second quarter of 2008 for prior period R&D tax credits. \nWe have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001. Many factors will impact our ability to\ncontinue to generate and grow cash from our operations including, but not limited to, the price of our service, the number of subscribers who sign up for our service and the growth or reduction in our subscriber base. \nIn September 2009, we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a $100 million three-year revolving credit facility. In October\n2009, the Company borrowed $20 million under the credit agreement. In November 2009, we issued $200 million of our 8.50% senior notes due in 2017. In connection with the notes offering, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our credit agreement\nand terminated it. Although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require or choose to obtain additional financing.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. \nOur primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations. Additionally, debt financing has also been a source of liquidity in fiscal\n2009. Our primary uses of cash include our stock repurchase programs, shipping and packaging expenses, the acquisition of content, capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment for operations, marketing and\nfulfillment expenses. \nIn addition, on August\u00a06, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock\nrepurchase program through the end of 2010 allowing us to repurchase $300 million of our common stock of which we have purchased $149.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2009. Subsequent to December\u00a031, 2009, we purchased an\n\n\nadditional $62.4 million of our common stock under the program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price, corporate and regulatory\nrequirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. The following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of December\u00a031, 2009, 2008 and 2007: \nDuring 2009, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $115.9 million, increased by non-cash adjustments of $254.9\nmillion and offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $45.7 million. The majority of the non-cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $219.5 million which increased by $9.7 million over\nthe prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base. The decrease in cash flow attributable to the net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content\nlibrary related to our streaming content, as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities increased $41.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. This was primarily due to an increase in\nnet income of $32.8 million, increased non-cash adjustments of $27.3 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19.1 million. \nDuring 2008, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $83.0 million, increased by non-cash adjustments of $227.6 million offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and\nliabilities of $26.6 million. The majority of the non-cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $209.8 million which increased by $6.3 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to\nsupport our larger subscriber base. The decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content, as we continued to increase our investments in streaming\ncontent in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities increased $6.6 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $16.4 million, increased non-cash adjustments of $32.3 million and a decrease in net\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities of $42.1 million. \nOur investing activities consisted primarily of purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, acquisitions of DVD content\nlibrary and purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities increased $101.1 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. This increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term\ninvestments of $105.0 million offset partially by a decrease in the purchases of short term investments of $29.0 million. In addition, acquisitions of DVDs increased by $30.2 million. \nCash used in investing activities decreased $291.1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in\nthe purchases of short-term investments of $148.4 million coupled with an increase in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $106.5 million. In addition, acquisitions of DVDs decreased by $45.8 million as more DVDs\nwere obtained through revenue sharing agreements in 2008. \nOur financing activities consist primarily of issuance of debt, repurchases of our common stock, issuance of common stock, and the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. Cash used by financing\nactivities decreased by $92.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the $193.9 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 8.50% senior notes and a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common\nstock through option exercises and through our employee stock purchase plan. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation increased by $7.5 million in 2009. These cash inflows were offset by an increase in repurchases of our\ncommon stock of $124.4 million. \nCash used by financing activities increased by $112.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007\nprimarily due to an increase in stock repurchases of $100.0\u00a0million. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation decreased by $21.0 million in 2008, as remaining benefits from net operating losses were utilized. This use\nof cash was offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $9.3 million. \nFor the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are\nenforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of\npayment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of December\u00a031, 2009. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes\nto agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December\u00a031, 2009 (in thousands): \nOther purchase obligations relate primarily to acquisitions for our content library and to marketing activities. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $13.2 million and an additional $0.9 million for gross\ninterest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the\ntiming of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \nIn addition to the above contractual obligations, we have certain license agreements with studios that include a\nmaximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future. Access to these titles is based on the discretion of the studios and, as such, we may not receive these titles. If we did receive access to the maximum number of titles, we would\nincur up to an additional $6 million in commitments during 2010. \nWe have not engaged in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities\noften referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not presently subject to off-balance sheet risks. \nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party\nmaking a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for\ncertain payments. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.
